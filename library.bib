abstract = {The ignimbrites are volcanic rocks formed by a single pyroclastic flow, a hot suspension of particles and gases that flow rapidly from a volcano, driven by a greater density than the surrounding atmosphere. it was suggested that the interior of volcanic rocks may be ideal substrates for microbial habitability (Bagshaw et al., 2011), for the preservation of biosignatures (Cockell et al., 2011), and even for prebiotic chemistry (Brasier et al., 2011). Recently Wierzchos et al. (2013) have shown that ignimbrites from the Atacama Desert are abundantly colonized by endolithic cyanobacteria and associated heterotrophic bacteria. As this is the first known verification of an endolithic microbial community colonizing ignimbrite rocks in an extremely dry environment. They pointed out the importance of the discovery, because the existence of a habitat capable of supporting abundant phototrophic and heterotrophic communities in an environment that precludes most life forms suggests that, if similar deposits are found on Mars these should be considered important targets in the search for life. The existence in our lab of microtomograph facilities, encourages us to undertaken a micro-CT analysis of ignimbrite's samples from Wierzchos et al. (2003) previous study. To explore pores and their contents, without manipulations that other techniques imply. Materials},

abstract = {Use of high-resolution micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging to assess trabecular and cortical bone morphology has grown immensely. There are several commercially available microCT systems, each with different approaches to image acquisition, evaluation, and reporting of outcomes. This lack of consistency makes it difficult to interpret reported results and to compare findings across different studies. This article addresses this critical need for standardized terminology and consistent reporting of parameters related to image acquisition and analysis, and key outcome assessments, particularly with respect to ex vivo analysis of rodent specimens. Thus the guidelines herein provide recommendations regarding (1) standardized terminology and units, (2) information to be included in describing the methods for a given experiment, and (3) a minimal set of outcome variables that should be reported. Whereas the specific research objective will determine the experimental design, these guidelines are intended to ensure accurate and consistent reporting of microCT-derived bone morphometry and density measurements. In particular, the methods section for papers that present microCT-based outcomes must include details of the following scan aspects: (1) image acquisition, including the scanning medium, X-ray tube potential, and voxel size, as well as clear descriptions of the size and location of the volume of interest and the method used to delineate trabecular and cortical bone regions, and (2) image processing, including the algorithms used for image filtration and the approach used for image segmentation. Morphometric analyses should be based on 3D algorithms that do not rely on assumptions about the underlying structure whenever possible. When reporting microCT results, the minimal set of variables that should be used to describe trabecular bone morphometry includes bone volume fraction and trabecular number, thickness, and separation. The minimal set of variables that should be used to describe cortical bone morphometry includes total cross-sectional area, cortical bone area, cortical bone area fraction, and cortical thickness. Other variables also may be appropriate depending on the research question and technical quality of the scan. Standard nomenclature, outlined in this article, should be followed for reporting of results. (c) 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.},

abstract = {Since the early beginnings of the Zoology, the study of the anatomy of little animals has been a challenge for researchers who developed many different techniques to be able to dissect them in a non-destructive way permitting to observe the internal organs and structures. Nowadays with the developments of the micro-CT techniques we have a very “attractive” and useful tool for that purpose. However, the preparation of the samples before to get the scan images and final volume rendering reconstructions still need particular essays to increase the knowledge permitting to generalize the use giving successful final reconstructions images. In previous papers we publish our experiences and the results obtained with some little invertebrate animals (Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}nchez- Tocino 2011 {\&} 2012; Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}inz-Cantero, 2010, 2012; Verd{\'{u}} et al., 2012). Following with this line we decided to continue enhancing the experience and in this case to investigate the common housefly. There are studies on this species, with references to the anatomy, since the eighteen century. However, It is not until the beginning of the twentieth century when Hewitt (1907) publish a detailed description, with nice illustrations of the anatomy. He used classical micro-anatomical reconstructions techniques to be able to obtain the final illustrations. Moreover he performed a technique that basically could remember what, nowadays, the micro-tomographic volume rendering reconstruction does. It worthwhile to cite how Hewitt described the procedure he followed: “The structure of the thoracic ganglion was studied by means of reconstructions. The method employed was as follows:—The sections were drawn by means of the camera lucida on Bristol board of a thickness proportional to the magnification. They were afterwards cut out and seccotined together. The resulting model was trimmed and soaked in melted paraffin, taken out and dipped several times till a thin coating of paraffin covered the model. This was then trimmed down to the original size, all the interstices having been filled by the paraffin. After a coating of graphite it was electrotyped with copper. ln this way a permanent model was obtained”. Thereafter, we decided to study this common species with the micro-CT.},

abstract = {Classical histology or immunohistochemistry combined with fluorescence or confocal laser scanning microscopy are common techniques in arthropod neuroanatomy, and these methods often require time-consuming and difficult dissections and sample preparations. Moreover, these methods are prone to artifacts due to compression and distortion of tissues, which often result in information loss and especially affect the spatial relationships of the examined parts of the nervous system in their natural anatomical context. Noninvasive approaches such as X-ray micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) can overcome such limitations and have been shown to be a valuable tool for understanding and visualizing internal anatomy and structural complexity. Nevertheless, knowledge about the potential of this method for analyzing the anatomy and organization of nervous systems, especially of taxa with smaller body size (e.g., many arthropods), is limited. This study set out to analyze the brains of selected arthropods with micro-CT, and to compare these results with available histological and immunohistochemical data. Specifically, we explored the influence of different sample preparation procedures. Our study shows that micro-CT is highly suitable for analyzing arthropod neuroarchitecture in situ and allows specific neuropils to be distinguished within the brain to extract quantitative data such as neuropil volumes. Moreover, data acquisition is considerably faster compared with many classical histological techniques. Thus, we conclude that micro-CT is highly suitable for targeting neuroanatomy, as it reduces the risk of artifacts and is faster than classical techniques.},

abstract = {In endotherms insects, the thermoregulatory mechanisms modulate heat transfer from the thorax to the abdomen to avoid overheating or cooling in order to obtain a prolonged flight performance. Scarabaeus sacer and S. cicatricosus, two sympatric species with the same habitat and food preferences, showed daily temporal segregation with S. cicatricosus being more active during warmer hours of the day in opposition to S. sacer who avoid it. In the case of S. sacer, their endothermy pattern suggested an adaptive capacity for thorax heat retention. In S. cicatricosus, an active 'heat exchanger' mechanism was suggested. However, no empirical evidence had been documented until now. Thermographic sequences recorded during flight performance showed evidence of the existence of both thermoregulatory mechanisms. In S. sacer, infrared sequences showed a possible heat insulator (passive thermal window), which prevents heat transfer from meso- and metathorax to the abdomen during flight. In S. cicatricosus, infrared sequences revealed clear and effective heat flow between the thorax and abdomen (abdominal heat transfer) that should be considered the main mechanism of thermoregulation. This was related to a subsequent increase in abdominal pumping (as a cooling mechanism) during flight. Computer microtomography scanning, anatomical dissections and internal air volume measurements showed two possible heat retention mechanisms for S. sacer; the abdominal air sacs and the development of the internal abdominal sternites that could explain the thermoregulation between thorax and abdomen. Our results suggest that interspecific interactions between sympatric species are regulated by very different mechanisms. These mechanisms create unique thermal niches for the different species, thereby preventing competition and modulating spatio-temporal distribution and the composition of dung beetle assemblages.},

@article{Metscher2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Comparative, functional, and developmental studies of animal morphology require accurate visualization of three-dimensional structures, but few widely applicable methods exist for non-destructive whole-volume imaging of animal tissues. Quantitative studies in particular require accurately aligned and calibrated volume images of animal structures. X-ray microtomography (microCT) has the potential to produce quantitative 3D images of small biological samples, but its widespread use for non-mineralized tissues has been limited by the low x-ray contrast of soft tissues. Although osmium staining and a few other techniques have been used for contrast enhancement, generally useful methods for microCT imaging for comparative morphology are still lacking.

RESULTS: Several very simple and versatile staining methods are presented for microCT imaging of animal soft tissues, along with advice on tissue fixation and sample preparation. The stains, based on inorganic iodine and phosphotungstic acid, are easier to handle and much less toxic than osmium, and they produce high-contrast x-ray images of a wide variety of soft tissues. The breadth of possible applications is illustrated with a few microCT images of model and non-model animals, including volume and section images of vertebrates, embryos, insects, and other invertebrates. Each image dataset contains x-ray absorbance values for every point in the imaged volume, and objects as small as individual muscle fibers and single blood cells can be resolved in their original locations and orientations within the sample.

CONCLUSION: With very simple contrast staining, microCT imaging can produce quantitative, high-resolution, high-contrast volume images of animal soft tissues, without destroying the specimens and with possibilities of combining with other preparation and imaging methods. Such images are expected to be useful in comparative, developmental, functional, and quantitative studies of morphology.},

Some of the pupal cases had been built as a new tube inside an existing tubular case. Moreover, for pupation, the last instar larvae clearly changed the architecture of the cases by adding internal and/or external grains of substrate at the tips. An architectural study with microCT techniques made it possible to divide each case into equal halves and to indirectly measure the weight of each. As no significant differences were found, it was concluded that pupa equilibrates its case, ensuring that it will lie horizontally on the substrate of the brook and thus avoid more vertical positions that might risk air exposure. The architectural changes could represent a survival strategy during pupation, in which the pupae remain in shallow channels ditches of the small brooks.},

abstract = {The “sea slugs” belong to the Nudibranchia, a group of molluscs (opistobranch gastropods) without shell. Most of them are beautiful tiny colored animals, either to imitate the habitat where they live and/or to warn about their toxicity to their potential predators. Many species have hard, and more or less acicular-shaped, structures (spicules) embedded in the external body wall (including the gills and the chemoreceptive tentacles or rhinophores). The spicules may disappear during the development lacking in adults and being presents only in the larval stages. With respect the origin, Ros (1976) proposed that spicules must correspond to a reminiscence of the typical in origin shell that mollusc species have. However with respect the possible function there is a controversy, existing two main hypothesis considering that the function may be either defensive, complementing the chemical defenses (i.e.: Thompson, 1960; Ros, 1976, 1977; Thompson {\&} Brown, 1976; Garc{\'{i}}a et al., 1986; Cattaneo-Vietti et al, 1993; W{\"{a}}gele {\&} Willan, 2000), or structural (Ros, 1976; Vayssi{\`{e}}re, 1901; Cattaneo-Vietti et al., 1993, 1995). Todd (1981) suggested that the presence of spicules decrease the energetic value of these animals, so they would not be desirable as preys. To add complexity to the problem, the shape, as well the spicule size varies not only by comparing different species, but also along the life cycle within the same species. Thereafter, it is clear that none of hypotheses are well supported and the problem is still no solved. Thus, to be able to clarify the situation looking for satisfactory evidences, we decided to use the possibilities of the micro-CT techniques to undertake a detailed study of the body structure of the species Polycera quadrilineata (M{\"{u}}ller, 1776) (Fig. 1). The species has numerous spicules, clearly visible under the light-microscope as quite big, with several axes, and sharpened (Fig. 2).},

abstract = {To determine the age if individuals of animal populations is a main goal in ecology, and conservation studies. This is especially crucial in the conservation of endangered species. In the case of reptiles different methodologies have been used (Halliday {\&} Verrell 1988; Yilmaz et al., 2005). Nowadays, skeleto-chronology is the most commonly used method for aging reptiles (Castanet et al.1977; Caetano, 1990; Castanet and Smirina, 1990; Francillon-Viellot et al., 1990). This technique utilizes stained cross- sections of long bones, which allow visualization of lines of arrested growth (LAG). Each LAG corresponds to an annual resting growth period and that the number of LAG represents the age of the animal (Gibbons and McCarthy, 1983; Caetano and Castanet, 1993). Correct interpretation of registered growth marks is not always an easy task, especially in small amphibians or reptiles, when the pattern of LAG in phalanges is less clearly visible, then it may be easier to use bigger bones, such as femur or humerus. Well-defined LAGs are registered in bones when activity is drastically constrained for some period because of harsh environmental conditions(usually during the winter periods). To be able to determine the age of small reptiles, as lizards, assessed by the “skeleto-chronology” technique, herpetologists use to amputate either fingers (in alive individuals), and/or an arm (on voucher specimens) to study the growth lines in cross sections of the bones. The process to prepare samples is tedious and high time consuming. It needs to demineralize bones, to cut them in a cryo-microtome to get cross-section slices of bones; later they must pass process with different chemicals to be able to fix and stain the tissues before to mount them in slides, before to study the samples under the light microscope. Moreover when dealing with endangered species, the injury of any amputation, even a finger, represents a serious problem from a conservational, and ethical, point of view. Thus with the aim to find a faster and less injuring methodology to find growth patterns on reptiles, we decided to investigate the possibilities of the microtomography.},

abstract = {In the last few years we have been actively working trying to find the best ways to get good results when scanning and reconstructing little invertebrate animals. Since we started to publish our first results (Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}inz-Cantero, 2010) with preliminary results using microtomography, we experienced significant improvements of the results, accordingly to implementations of techniques and in parallel with our scanning and software reconstruction skills, in parallel to new developments of the Bruker-Skyscan software. This is very apparent when comparing the images obtained in successive years (Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}inz-Cantero, 2010; Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}nchez-Tocino, 2011; Alba-Tercedor, 2012; Alba-Tercedor et al., 2012; Verd{\'{u}} et al., 2012; Alba-Tercedor, 2013; Alba-Tercedor et al., 2013b,2013c), and videos as well (see links [13]). Because we have been receiving many requests asking us to explain how to proceed to achieve these results, we decided to summarize the steps we more often follow, from the sample preparation until the visualization of the volume renderings. However, this paper cannot be considered neither pretends to be, a substitute of the “methods notes” and manuals of the software that Bruker-Skyscan produces, but a complementary guides aiming to help users to avoid the frustrations and waste of time that many times we have experienced.},

abstract = {Intimate partner violence affects millions of people globally. One possible contributing factor is poor self-control. Self-control requires energy, part of which is provided by glucose. For 21 days, glucose levels were measured in 107 married couples. To measure aggressive impulses, each evening participants stuck between 0 and 51 pins into a voodoo doll that represented their spouse, depending how angry they were with their spouse. To measure aggression, participants competed against their spouse on a 25-trial task in which the winner blasted the loser with loud noise through headphones. As expected, the lower the level of glucose in the blood, the greater number of pins participants stuck into the voodoo doll, and the higher intensity and longer duration of noise participants set for their spouse.},

abstract = {Histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), also known as histidine-proline-rich glyco-protein, is an abundant and well-characterized protein of vertebrate plasma. HRG has a multidomain structure that allows the molecule to interact with many ligands, including heparin, phospholipids, plasminogen, fibrinogen, immunoglobulin G, C1q, heme, and Zn²(+). The ability of HRG to interact with various ligands simultaneously has suggested that HRG can function as an adaptor molecule and regulate numerous important biologic processes, such as immune complex/necrotic cell/pathogen clearance, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, coagulation, and fibrinolysis. The present review covers the proposed multifunctional roles of HRG with a focus on recent findings that have led to its emergence as a key regulator of immunity and vascular biology. Also included is a discussion of the striking functional similarities between HRG and other important multifunctional proteins found in plasma, such as C-reactive protein, C1q, $\beta$₂ glycoprotein I, and thrombospondin-1.},

abstract = {In a collision between two objects, we can perceive not only low-level properties, such as color and motion, but also the seemingly high-level property of causality. It has proven difficult, however, to measure causal perception in a quantitatively rigorous way which goes beyond perceptual reports. Here we focus on the possibility of measuring perceived causality using the phenomenon of representational momentum (RM). Recent studies suggest a relationship between causal perception and RM, based on the fact that RM appears to be attenuated for causally 'launched' objects. This is explained by appeal to the visual expectation that a 'launched' object is inert and thus should eventually cease its movement after a collision, without a source of self-propulsion. We first replicated these demonstrations, and then evaluated this alleged connection by exploring RM for different types of displays, including the contrast between causal launching and non-causal 'passing'. These experiments suggest that the RM-attenuation effect is not a pure measure of causal perception, but rather may reflect lower-level spatiotemporal correlates of only some causal displays. We conclude by discussing the strengths and pitfalls of various methods of measuring causal perception. ?? 2006.},

abstract = {We demonstrate by means of simple, noninvasive methods (analysis of satellite images, field observations, and measuring "deer beds" in snow) that domestic cattle (n = 8,510 in 308 pastures) across the globe, and grazing and resting red and roe deer (n = 2,974 at 241 localities), align their body axes in roughly a north-south direction. Direct observations of roe deer revealed that animals orient their heads northward when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers, or hunters. Because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation, magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation. To test the hypothesis that cattle orient their body axes along the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field, we analyzed the body orientation of cattle from localities with high magnetic declination. Here, magnetic north was a better predictor than geographic north. This study reveals the magnetic alignment in large mammals based on statistically sufficient sample sizes. Our findings open horizons for the study of magnetoreception in general and are of potential significance for applied ethology (husbandry, animal welfare). They challenge neuroscientists and biophysics to explain the proximate mechanisms.},

In this special issue we pay tribute to this heritage with a collection of empirical and theoretical papers on amodal completion and the perception of causality, two areas of research within which Michotte's work and ideas have had a lasting influence. As a background to better understand the remaining papers, we briefly sketch Michotte's life and work and the scope (in breadth and in depth) of his impact. We then review Michotte's seminal contributions to the areas covered in this special issue, some of the major research discoveries and themes in the intervening decades, and the major open questions and challenges we are still facing. We also include a sneak preview of the papers in this special issue, noting how they relate to Michotte's work and to each other. This review shows both how much influence Michotte has had on contemporary perception and cognition research, and how much important work remains to be done. We hope that the papers in this special issue will serve both to celebrate Michotte's heritage in this respect, and to inspire other investigators to continue the projects he began. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) continues to view with concern the lean pipeline for novel therapeutics to treat drug-resistant infections, especially those caused by gram-negative pathogens. Infections now occur that are resistant to all current antibacterial options. Although the IDSA is encouraged by the prospect of success for some agents currently in preclinical development, there is an urgent, immediate need for new agents with activity against these panresistant organisms. There is no evidence that this need will be met in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we remain concerned that the infrastructure for discovering and developing new antibacterials continues to stagnate, thereby risking the future pipeline of antibacterial drugs. The IDSA proposed solutions in its 2004 policy report, "Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic R{\&}D Stagnates, a Public Health Crisis Brews," and recently issued a "Call to Action" to provide an update on the scope of the problem and the proposed solutions. A primary objective of these periodic reports is to encourage a community and legislative response to establish greater financial parity between the antimicrobial development and the development of other drugs. Although recent actions of the Food and Drug Administration and the 110th US Congress present a glimmer of hope, significant uncertainly remains. Now, more than ever, it is essential to create a robust and sustainable antibacterial research and development infrastructure--one that can respond to current antibacterial resistance now and anticipate evolving resistance. This challenge requires that industry, academia, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US Department of Defense, and the new Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority at the Department of Health and Human Services work productively together. This report provides an update on potentially effective antibacterial drugs in the late-stage development pipeline, in the hope of encouraging such collaborative action.},

Our first study uses a large dataset of more than five million posts to quantify ephemerality in /b/. We find that most threads spend just five seconds on the first page and less than five minutes on the site before expiring. Our second study is an analysis of identity signals on 4chan, finding that over 90{\%} of posts are made by fully anonymous users, with other identity signals adopted and discarded at will.

abstract = {We observed a total of 57 incidences of copulation in a colony of the Indian flying fox, Pteropus giganteus, over 13 months under natural conditions. The colony consisted of about 420 individuals, roosting in a Ficus religiosa tree. Copulations occurred between 07.00 h and 09.30 h from July to January, with more occurring in October and November. Initially males groomed their penis before approaching a nearby female. Females typically moved away and males followed. When the female stopped moving, the male started licking her vagina (cunnilingus). Typically each bout of cunnilingus lasted for about 50 s. In 57 out of 69 observations, the male mounted the female and copulated. The duration of copulation varied from 10 to 20 sec. After completion of copulation, the male continued cunnilingus for 94 to 188 sec. The duration of pre-copulatory cunnilingus and copulation was positively correlated whereas, the duration of pre- and post-copulatory cunnilingus was negatively correlated. Apart from humans, oral sex as foreplay prior to copulation is uncommon in mammals. Another pteropodid bat, Cynopterus sphinx exhibits fellatio with females licking the penis of males during copulation. It appears that bats, especially pteropodids perform oral sex, either cunnilingus or fellatio, possibly for achieving longer copulation.},

Both prenatal testosterone and the AR play a central role in penile growth. In this study, we investigated the relationship between digit ratio and penile length. Korean men who were hospitalized for urological surgery at a single tertiary academic centre were examined in this study, and 144 men aged 20 years or older who gave informed consent were prospectively enrolled. Right-hand second- and fourth-digit lengths were measured by a single investigator prior to measurement of penile length. Under anaesthesia, flaccid and stretched penile lengths were measured by another investigator who did not measure nor have any the information regarding the digit lengths. Univariate and multivariate analysis using linear regression models showed that only height was a significant predictive factor for flaccid penile length (univariate analysis: r=0.185, P=0.026; multivariate analysis: r=0.172, P=0.038) and that only digit ratio was a significant predictive factor for stretched penile length (univariate analysis:r=-0.216, P=0.009; multivariate analysis: r=-0.201, P=0.024; stretched penile length=-9.201×digit ratio + 20.577). Based on this evidence, we suggest that the digit ratio can predict adult penile size and that the effects of prenatal testosterone may in part explain the differences in adult penile length.Asian Journal of Andrology advance online publication, 4 July 2011; doi:10.1038/aja.2011.75.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe male spine movement and posture characteristics during coitus and compare these characteristics across 5 common coital positions. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Exacerbation of pain during coitus due to coital movements and positions is a prevalent issue reported by low back pain patients. A biomechanical analysis of spine movements and postures during coitus has never been conducted. METHODS: Ten healthy males and females engaged in coitus in the following preselected positions and variations: QUADRUPED, MISSIONARY, and SIDELYING. An optoelectronic motion capture system was used to measure 3-dimensional lumbar spine angles that were normalized to upright standing. To determine whether each coital position had distinct spine kinematic profiles, separate univariate general linear models, followed by Tukey's honestly significant difference post hoc analysis were used. The presentation of coital positions was randomized. RESULTS: Both variations of QUADRUPED, mQUAD1 and mQUAD2, were found to have a significantly higher cycle speed than mSIDE (P = 0.043 and P = 0.034, respectively), mMISS1 (P = 0.003 and P = 0.002, respectively), and mMISS2 (P = 0.001 and P {\textless} 0.001, respectively). Male lumbar spine movement varied depending on the coital position; however, across all positions, the majority of the range of motion used was in flexion. Based on range of motion, the least-to-most recommended positions for a male flexion-intolerant patient are mSIDE, mMISS2, mQUAD2, mMISS1, and mQUAD1. CONCLUSION: Initial recommendations-which include specific coital positions to avoid, movement strategies, and role of the partner-were developed for male patients whose low back pain is exacerbated by specific motions and postures.

abstract = {Ensemble musicians play in synchrony despite expressively motivated irregularities in timing. We hypothesized that synchrony is achieved by each performer internally simulating the concurrent actions of other ensemble members, relying initially on how they would perform in their stead. Hence, musicians should be better at synchronizing with recordings of their own earlier performances than with others' recordings. We required pianists to record one part from each of several piano duets, and later to play the complementary part in synchrony with their own or others' recordings. The pianists were also asked to identify their own recordings. The pianists were better at synchronizing with their own than with others' performances, and they were able to recognize their own recordings. Furthermore, synchronization accuracy and recognition were correlated: Pianists who were relatively accurate at synchronizing with their own performances were also good at recognizing them. Thus, action simulation may underlie both synchronization and self-recognition.},

abstract = {The average potency of illicit marijuana in the USA has increased substantially over the past four decades, and observers have suggested a number of likely reasons for this. One set of hypotheses points to a market that has evolved from foreign to domestic sources of supply, and to continuing advances in sophisticated cultivation techniques. Another set of hypotheses points to testing artifacts related to changes in the sampling, handling, and testing of illicit marijuana. The current study uses data from the federally sponsored Potency Monitoring Program, which performs ongoing forensic analysis of seized marijuana samples, to assess the extent to which the observed increase in cannabis potency in the USA between 1970 and 2010 is a function of genuine shifts in illicit marijuana markets or testing artifacts related to changes in the quality of seized marijuana. The study finds, after adjusting for marijuana quality, that the apparent 10.5 factor increase in mean reported THC{\%} between the 1970s and the 2000s is instead on the order of a six- to seven-fold increase. By this accounting, then, the reported long-term rise in potency is roughly 57-67{\%} as great when the quality of the tested marijuana is taken into account. This study's findings, therefore, caution against the uncritical use of potency monitoring data and highlight the importance of assessing potency measurement reliability and addressing data quality issues in future policy analytic research.

abstract = {The chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has been devastating amphibians globally. Two general scenarios have been proposed for the nature and spread of this pathogen: Bd is an epidemic, spreading as a wave and wiping out individuals, populations, and species in its path; and Bd is endemic, widespread throughout many geographic regions on every continent except Antarctica. To explore these hypotheses, we conducted a transcontinental transect of United States Department of Defense (DoD) installations along U.S. Highway 66 from California to central Illinois, and continuing eastward to the Atlantic Seaboard along U.S. Interstate 64 (in sum from Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia). We addressed the following questions: 1) Does Bd occur in amphibian populations on protected DoD environments? 2) Is there a temporal pattern to the presence of Bd? 3) Is there a spatial pattern to the presence of Bd? and 4) In these limited human-traffic areas, is Bd acting as an epidemic (i.e., with evidence of recent introduction and/or die-offs due to chytridiomycosis), or as an endemic (present without clinical signs of disease)? Bd was detected on 13 of the 15 bases sampled. Samples from 30 amphibian species were collected (10{\%} of known United States' species); half (15) tested Bd positive. There was a strong temporal (seasonal) component; in total, 78.5{\%} of all positive samples came in the first (spring/early-summer) sampling period. There was also a strong spatial component—the eleven temperate DoD installations had higher prevalences of Bd infection (20.8{\%}) than the four arid ({\textless}60 mm annual precipitation) bases (8.5{\%}). These data support the conclusion that Bd is now widespread, and promote the idea that Bd can today be considered endemic across much of North America, extending from coast-to-coast, with the exception of remote pockets of na{\"{i}}ve populations.},

abstract = {An individual's susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure constitutes a risk factor for physical and mental health. Different factors such as inefficiency of executive functioning and high trait impulsivity have been shown to affect this susceptibility. Furthermore, twin studies indicate a high heritability of failure susceptibility revealing genetic variables as an important biological influence. We tested for a molecular genetic association between variants on the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2), which relate to executive control and impulsivity, and susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure as assessed by the Cognitive Failure Questionnaire (CFQ) in a sample of N=500 (n=140 male, n=360 female, mean age M=24.62, SD=7.98) healthy participants of central European descent. Moreover, we assessed whether trait impulsivity as measured by the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) qualifies as a mediator between DRD2 variants and CFQ scores. We found a positive association between DRD2 variants and the CFQ. This effect was in part yet not completely mediated by trait impulsivity. The DRD2C/C variant constitutes a protective factor for the susceptibility to everyday cognitive failure. Results point towards at least two biopsychological pathways that may explain the observed effect.},

@article{Schlottmann2006,
abstract = {Michotte argued that we perceive cause-and-effect, without contributions from reasoning or learning, even in displays of two-dimensional moving shapes. Two studies extend this line of work from perception of mechanical to social causality. We compared verbal reports with structured ratings of causality to gain a better understanding of the extent to which perceptual causality occurs spontaneously or depends on instruction or context. A total of 120 adult observers (72 in the main experiment, 48 in an initial experiment) saw 12 (or 8) different computer animations of shape A moving up to B, which in turn moved away. Animations factorially varied the temporal and spatial relations of the shapes, and whether they moved rigidly or in a non-rigid, animal-like manner. Impressions of social as well as physical causality appeared in both free reports and ratings. Perception of physical causality was stronger than perception of social causality, particularly in free reports. No differences of this nature appear in infants and children, so the asymmetry may reflect learnt knowledge. Physical causality was relatively unspecific initially, but discrimination of causal and delayed control events improved with exposure to multiple events. Experience seems to affect the causal illusion even over a short timeframe; the idea of 'one-trial causality' may be somewhat misleading. Regardless of such effects on the absolute level of responses, the different measures showed similar patterns of variation with the spatio-temporal configuration and type of motion. The good fit of ratings and reports validates much recent work in this area. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {It is only by fixing on agreed meanings of terms in biomedical terminologies that we will be in a position to achieve that accumulation and integration of knowledge that is indispensable to progress at the frontiers of biomedicine. Standardly, the goal of fixing meanings is seen as being realized through the alignment of terms on what are called ‘concepts.' Part I addresses three versions of the concept-based approach—by Cimino, by W{\"{u}}ster, and by Campbell and associates—and surveys some of the problems to which they give rise, all of which have to do with a failure to anchor the terms in terminologies to corresponding referents in reality. Part II outlines a new, realist solution to this anchorage problem, which sees terminology construction as being motivated by the goal of alignment not on concepts but on the universals (kinds, types) in reality and thereby also on the corresponding instances (individuals, tokens). We outline the realist approach and show how on its basis we can provide a benchmark of correctness for terminologies which will at the same time allow a new type of integration of terminologies and electronic health records. We conclude by outlining ways in which the framework thus defined might be exploited for purposes of diagnostic decision-support.},

Results We identified 18 different roles filled by librarians and other information professionals in conducting systematic reviews from 310 different articles, book chapters, and presented papers and posters. Some roles were well known such as searching, source selection, and teaching. Other less documented roles included planning, question formulation, and peer review. We summarize these different roles and provide an accompanying bibliography of references for in-depth descriptions of these roles. Conclusion Librarians play central roles in systematic review teams, including roles that go beyond searching. This scoping review should encourage librarians who are fulfilling roles that are not captured here to document their roles in journal articles and poster and paper presentations.},

abstract = {Traditionally, research on romantic and sexual relationships has focused on one-night stands and monogamous pairs. However, as the result of men and women pursuing their ideal relationship types, various compromise relationships may emerge. One such compromise is explored here: the "booty call." The results of an act-nomination and frequency study of college students provided an initial definition and exploration of this type of relationship. Booty calls tend to utilize various communication mediums to facilitate sexual contact among friends who, for men, may represent low-investment, attractive sexual partners and, for women, may represent attractive test-mates. The relationship is discussed as a compromise between men's and women's ideal mating strategies that allows men greater sexual access and women an ongoing opportunity to evaluate potential long-term mates.},

abstract = {Humans have the unique ability to create art, but non-human animals may be able to discriminate "good" art from "bad" art. In this study, I investigated whether pigeons could be trained to discriminate between paintings that had been judged by humans as either "bad" or "good". To do this, adult human observers first classified several children's paintings as either "good" (beautiful) or "bad" (ugly). Using operant conditioning procedures, pigeons were then reinforced for pecking at "good" paintings. After the pigeons learned the discrimination task, they were presented with novel pictures of both "good" and "bad" children's paintings to test whether they had successfully learned to discriminate between these two stimulus categories. The results showed that pigeons could discriminate novel "good" and "bad" paintings. Then, to determine which cues the subjects used for the discrimination, I conducted tests of the stimuli when the paintings were of reduced size or grayscale. In addition, I tested their ability to discriminate when the painting stimuli were mosaic and partial occluded. The pigeons maintained discrimination performance when the paintings were reduced in size. However, discrimination performance decreased when stimuli were presented as grayscale images or when a mosaic effect was applied to the original stimuli in order to disrupt spatial frequency. Thus, the pigeons used both color and pattern cues for their discrimination. The partial occlusion did not disrupt the discriminative behavior suggesting that the pigeons did not attend to particular parts, namely upper, lower, left or right half, of the paintings. These results suggest that the pigeons are capable of learning the concept of a stimulus class that humans name "good" pictures. The second experiment showed that pigeons learned to discriminate watercolor paintings from pastel paintings. The subjects showed generalization to novel paintings. Then, as the first experiment, size reduction test, grayscale test, mosaic processing test and partial occlusion test were carried out. The results suggest that the pigeons used both color and pattern cues for the discrimination and show that non-human animals, such as pigeons, can be trained to discriminate abstract visual stimuli, such as pictures and may also have the ability to learn the concept of "beauty" as defined by humans.},

abstract = {Phenomenal causality is an illusion built on an incomplete perception. It is an illusion because we can have visual impressions of causality when no interaction between objects is actually taking place. It is an illusion built on an incomplete perception because causality as we understand it neglects some factors involved in objective descriptions of interactions between objects in terms of the laws of mechanics. So, why don't we perceive object interactions in accordance with the laws of mechanics? I first consider what kinds of things can and cannot be causes perceptually, arguing that active objects can be causes and non-moving objects cannot be. Then, I argue that causal understanding originates with what we have the most direct experience of, our own actions on objects, and extends out from this point of origin to other domains of causality by a form of schema matching the interpretation of stimulus input by matching to abstracted stored representations of experiences. Schema matching raises the possibility of many more kinds of phenomenal causality than have hitherto been considered, and I conclude by suggesting some possibilities. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hard facts on a soft matter! In their popular scientific book (Leyner M, Goldberg B. Why do men have nipples - hundreds of questions you'd only ask a doctor after your third martini. New York: Three Rivers Press; 2005), Leyner and Goldberg raised the question why "some belly buttons collect so much lint". They were, however, not able to come up with a satisfactory answer. The hypothesis presented herein says that abdominal hair is mainly responsible for the accumulation of navel lint, which, therefore, this is a typically male phenomenon. The abdominal hair collects fibers from cotton shirts and directs them into the navel where they are compacted to a felt-like matter. The most abundant individual mass of a piece of lint was found to be between 1.20 and 1.29 mg (n=503). However, due to several much larger pieces, the average mass was 1.82 mg in this three year study. When the abdominal hair is shaved, no more lint is collected. Old T-shirts or dress shirts produce less navel fuzz than brand new T-shirts. Using elemental analysis, it could be shown that cotton lint contains a certain amount of foreign material, supposedly cutaneous scales, fat or proteins. Incidentally, lint might thus fulfill a cleaning function for the navel.},

abstract = {When the moon is absent from the night sky, stars remain as celestial visual cues. Nonetheless, only birds, seals, and humans are known to use stars for orientation. African ball-rolling dung beetles exploit the sun, the moon, and the celestial polarization pattern to move along straight paths, away from the intense competition at the dung pile. Even on clear moonless nights, many beetles still manage to orientate along straight paths. This led us to hypothesize that dung beetles exploit the starry sky for orientation, a feat that has, to our knowledge, never been demonstrated in an insect. Here, we show that dung beetles transport their dung balls along straight paths under a starlit sky but lose this ability under overcast conditions. In a planetarium, the beetles orientate equally well when rolling under a full starlit sky as when only the Milky Way is present. The use of this bidirectional celestial cue for orientation has been proposed for vertebrates, spiders, and insects, but never proven. This finding represents the first convincing demonstration for the use of the starry sky for orientation in insects and provides the first documented use of the Milky Way for orientation in the animal kingdom.},

Although this transition is irreversible, it carries potential for several robotic applications. Here, we examine relevant characteristics of three types of ker-nels including expansion ratio, transition temperature, popping force, compression strength, and biodegradability. We test the viability of popping by hot oil, hot air, microwaves, and direct contact with heated Nichrome wire. As kernels can change from regular to (larger) irregular shapes, we examine the change in inter-granular friction and propose their use as granular fluids in jamming actuators, without the need for a vacuum pump. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, we also demonstrate the use of popcorn-driven actuation in soft, compliant, and rigid-link grippers. Serving as a first introduction of popcorn into robotics, we hope this paper will inspire novel mechanisms for multi-functional designs.},

The same benefits are mentioned over and over, with only passing acknowledgement of potential harms such as offense, distraction, and eroding the gravitas or authority of its user.  Isn't it time for an article that differentiates between the physical act of laughing and the mental gymnastics of “getting” humor? Can't we go beyond speculating about whether humor or laughter might help, or could help? Even if we could demonstrate that humor did help in a certain situation, would that justify it as the treatment of choice? Wouldn't we have to demonstrate that humor worked better than established methods, whose side effects are well known and can be managed?  Using humor for any reason other than superior effectiveness seems self-indulgent, and we are notoriously immune to counter-evidence when we are indulging ourselves. It is often blithely said that journalist Norman Cousins laughed his way out of a fatal disease. We too easily ignore facts such as Cousins' likely misdiagnosis with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). We now know that it is largely genetic, with more than 90{\%} of those affected having the genotype HLA-B27 (Spondylitis Association of America, 2009). It seems unlikely that Cousins suddenly acquired this during a trip to Russia. Even if he had actually had AS, his recovery would have been fortunate, but not miraculous. When his friend, Dr. Hitzig, consulted the experts at Dr. Howard Rusk's clinic, he was told that Cousins had one chance in 500 of a full recovery (Cousins, 1979/2005, p. 33).  Because we are enjoying our use of humor, we too easily buy into folk wisdom, such as the notion that laughter generates or increases the flow of endorphins (rarely tested and never found). We believe that adults laugh only 15 times per day, while children laugh more than 400 times (no one has found a legitimate source for this claim). We are quick to judge the client who does not appreciate our humor as depressed or resistant. We are quick to take our friends' laughter as evidence of our effectiveness. I have seen many people using humor that interferes with their productivity and/or relationships, but who are firmly convinced that it makes them better workers.  I want to challenge professional researchers to give this matter more objective and rigorous investigation.},

As predicted, men who played video games perceived to be high in sexism showed higher levels of benevolent sexism, compared with men who did not play such games. This relationship was not evident for women. Importantly, our study provides the first known evidence of a link between long-term exposure to sexist video games and sexist attitudes.

abstract = {Although much research has examined the effect of income on happiness, we suggest that how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn. Specifically, we hypothesized that spending money on other people may have a more positive impact on happiness than spending money on oneself. Providing converging evidence for this hypothesis, we found that spending more of one's income on others predicted greater happiness both cross-sectionally (in a nationally representative survey study) and longitudinally (in a field study of windfall spending). Finally, participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others experienced greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves.},

abstract = {People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities.},

abstract = {Face pareidolia is the illusory perception of non-existent faces. The present study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50{\%} of them contained either faces or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34{\%} and 38{\%} of the time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific response when participants "saw" faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.},

abstract = {Compared to single energy CT, which only provides information for x-ray linear attenuation coefficients, dual-energy CT is able to obtain both the electron density and effective atomic number for different materials in a quantitative way. In this study, as an alternative to dual-energy CT, a novel quantitative imaging method based on phase contrast CT is presented. Rather than requiring two projection data sets with different x-ray energy spectra, diffraction-grating-based phase contrast CT is capable of reconstructing images of both linear attenuation and refractive index decrement from the same projection data using a single x-ray energy spectra. From the two images, quantitative information of both the electron density and effective atomic number can be extracted. Two physical phantoms were constructed and used to validate the presented method. Experimental results demonstrate that (1) electron density can be accurately determined from refractive index decrement through a linear relationship, and (2) the effective atomic number can be explicitly derived from the ratio of the linear attenuation to refractive index decrement using a power function plus a constant. The presented method will provide insight into the technique of material separation and find its use in medical and industrial applications.},

abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The US government spends more than {\$}200 million annually on abstinence-promotion programs, including virginity pledges. This study compares the sexual activity of adolescent virginity pledgers with matched nonpledgers by using more robust methods than past research. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The subjects for this study were National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health respondents, a nationally representative sample of middle and high school students who, when surveyed in 1995, had never had sex or taken a virginity pledge and who were {\textgreater}15 years of age (n = 3440). Adolescents who reported taking a virginity pledge on the 1996 survey (n = 289) were matched with nonpledgers (n = 645) by using exact and nearest-neighbor matching within propensity score calipers on factors including prepledge religiosity and attitudes toward sex and birth control. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers were compared 5 years after the pledge on self-reported sexual behaviors and positive test results for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis, and safe sex outside of marriage by use of birth control and condoms in the past year and at last sex. RESULTS: Five years after the pledge, 82{\%} of pledgers denied having ever pledged. Pledgers and matched nonpledgers did not differ in premarital sex, sexually transmitted diseases, and anal and oral sex variables. Pledgers had 0.1 fewer past-year partners but did not differ in lifetime sexual partners and age of first sex. Fewer pledgers than matched nonpledgers used birth control and condoms in the past year and birth control at last sex. CONCLUSIONS: The sexual behavior of virginity pledgers does not differ from that of closely matched nonpledgers, and pledgers are less likely to protect themselves from pregnancy and disease before marriage. Virginity pledges may not affect sexual behavior but may decrease the likelihood of taking precautions during sex. Clinicians should provide birth control information to all adolescents, especially virginity pledgers.},

Promising results have recently been obtained in materials science and medicine. At the same time, the lack of a mathematical theory comparable with that of conventional CT limits the progress in this field. Such a theory is now suggested, establishing a fundamental relation between the three-dimensional Radon transform of the object function and the two-dimensional Radon transform of the phase-contrast projection. A reconstruction algorithm is derived in the form of a filtered backprojection. The filter function is given in the space and spatial-frequency domains. The theory suggested enables one to quantitatively determine the refractive index of a weakly absorbing medium from x-ray intensity data measured in the near-field region. The results of computer simulations are discussed.},

abstract = {We assesses the efficiency of x-ray Talbot interferometry (XTI), a technique based on the Talbot effect for measuring a wavefront gradient, in terms of how quickly it can capture a high-quality phase image with a large signal-to-noise ratio for a given incident photon number. Photon statistics cause errors in the phase of the moir{\'{e}} fringes and impose a detection limit on the wavefront gradient. The relation between the incident photon number and the detection limit is determined, and a figure of merit of XTI for a monochromatic cone beam is then defined. The dependence of the figure of merit on optical system parameters, such as grating pitch and position, is then discussed. The effects of varying the pattern height and linewidth of the second grating are shown for rectangular and trapezoidal teeth. Finally, we show how to design a practical cone-beam Talbot interferometer for certain boundary conditions.},

abstract = {The measurement of the linear attenuation coefficients of breast tissues is of fundamental importance in the field of breast x-ray diagnostic imaging. Different groups have evaluated the linear attenuation coefficients of breast tissues by carrying out direct attenuation measurements in which the specimens were thin and selected as homogeneous as possible. Here, we use monochromatic and high-intensity synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SR CT) to evaluate the linear attenuation coefficients of surgical breast tissues in the energy range from 15 to 26.5 keV. X-ray detection is performed by a custom digital silicon micro-strip device, developed in the framework of the PICASSO INFN experiment. Twenty-three human surgical breast samples were selected for SR CT and histological study. Six of them underwent CT, both as fresh tissue and after formalin fixation, while the remaining 17 were imaged only as formalin-fixed tissues. Our results for fat and fibrous tissues are in good agreement with the published values. However, in contrast to the published data, our measurements show no significant differences between fibrous and tumor tissues. Moreover, our results for fresh and formalin-fixed tissues demonstrate a reduction of the linear attenuation coefficient for fibrous and tumor tissues after fixation.},

The technique is capable of recording the phase shift of hard X-rays travelling through a sample, which greatly enhances the contrast of low absorbing specimen compared to conventional amplitude contrast images. Unlike other existing X-ray phase contrast imaging methods, the grating interferometer also works with incoherent radiation from a standard X-ray tube. The key components are three gratings with silicon and gold structures, which have dimensions in the micrometer range and high aspect ratios. The fabrication processes, which involve photolithography, anisotropic wet etching, and electroplating, are described in this article for each of the three gratings. An example of an X-ray phase contrast image acquired with the grating interferometer is given.},

abstract = {The global prevalence of dementia is estimated to be as high as 24 million, and is predicted to double every 20 years through to 2040, leading to a costly burden of disease. Alzheimer disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive decline in cognitive function, which typically begins with deterioration in memory. Before death, individuals with this disorder have usually become dependent on caregivers. The neuropathological hallmarks of the AD brain are diffuse and neuritic extracellular amyloid plaques-which are frequently surrounded by dystrophic neurites-and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. These hallmark pathologies are often accompanied by the presence of reactive microgliosis and the loss of neurons, white matter and synapses. The etiological mechanisms underlying the neuropathological changes in AD remain unclear, but are probably affected by both environmental and genetic factors. Here, we provide an overview of the criteria used in the diagnosis of AD, highlighting how this disease is related to, but distinct from, normal aging. We also summarize current information relating to AD prevalence, incidence and risk factors, and review the biomarkers that may be used for risk assessment and in diagnosis.},

Non-irradiated sucrose solutions are optically "empty" in the visible and near UV range. After gamma irradiation an absorption band with a maximum at 263 nm appears. It was confirmed that this band can be used as dosimetric signal for the dose range: 1-10 kGy. The species responsible for the 263 nm band is a neutral product of sucrose oxidation by an OH radical. High energy electron irradiation creates another UV absorbing species with the absorption band peaked at 270 nm. Further investigations are necessary to establish to what extent it can be used for electron beam dosimetry.},

This work focuses on grating-based differential phase-contrast imaging. A mathematical framework is derived that is able to analytically predict the relative performance of both imaging techniques in the sense of the relative contrast-to-noise ratio for the contrast of any two materials. Two fundamentally different properties of PCT compared with CT are identified. First, the noise power spectra show qualitatively different characteristics implying a resolution-dependent performance ratio. The break-even point is derived analytically as a function of system parameters such as geometry and visibility. A superior performance of PCT compared with CT can only be achieved at a sufficiently high spatial resolution. Second, due to periodicity of phase information which is non-ambiguous only in a bounded interval statistical phase wrapping can occur. This effect causes a collapse of information propagation for low signals which limits the applicability of phase-contrast imaging at low dose.},

abstract = {The small trees of gas-exchanging pulmonary airways which are fed by the most distal purely conducting airways are called acini and represent the functional gas-exchanging units. The three-dimensional architecture of the acini has a strong influence on ventilation and particle deposition. Due to the difficulty to identify individual acini on microscopic lung sections the knowledge about the number of acini and their biological parameters like volume, surface area, and number of alveoli per acinus are limited. We developed a method to extract individual acini from lungs imaged by high-resolution synchrotron radiation based X-ray tomographic microscopy and estimated their volume, surface area and number of alveoli. Rat acini were isolated by semiautomatically closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas-exchanging airways. We estimated a mean internal acinar volume of 1.148mm3, a mean acinar surface area of 73.9mm2, and a mean of 8470 alveoli per acinus. Assuming that the acini are similarly sized throughout different regions of the lung, we calculated that a rat lung contains 5470{\{}+/-{\}}833 acini. We conclude that our novel approach is well suited for the fast and reliable characterization of a large number of individual acini in healthy, diseased, or transgenic lungs of different species including humans.},

abstract = {Assessing the role of osteocyte lacunae and the ways in which they communicate with one another is important for determining the function and viability of bone tissue. Osteocytes are able to play a significant role in bone development and remodeling because they can receive nourishment from, interact with, and communicate with other cells. In this sense the immediate environment of an osteocyte is crucial for understanding its function. Modern imaging techniques, ranging from synchrotron radiation-based computed tomography (SR CT) to confocal laser scanning microscopy, produce large volumes of high-quality imaging data of bone tissue on the micrometer scale in rapidly shortening times. These images often contain tens of thousands of osteocytes and their lacunae, void spaces which enclose the osteocytes. While theoretically possible, quantitative analysis of the osteocyte lacunar system is too time consuming to be practical without highly automated tools. Moreover, quantitative morphometry of the osteocyte lacunar system necessitates clearly defined, robust, and three-dimensional (3D) measures. Here, we introduce a framework for the quantitative characterization of millions of osteocyte lacunae and their spatial relationships in 3D. The metrics complement and expand previous works looking at shape and number density while providing novel measures for quantifying spatial distribution and alignment. We developed model, in silico systems to visualize and validate the metrics and provide a concrete example of the attribute being classified with each metric. We then illustrate the applicability to biological samples in a first study comparing two strains of mice and the effect of growth hormone. We found significant differences in shape and distribution between strains for alignment. The proposed quantitative framework can be used in future studies examining differences and treatment effects in bone microstructure at the cell scale. Furthermore, the proposed strategy for quantitative bone cell morphometry will allow investigating structure-function relationships in bone tissue, for example by linking cellular morphometry to bone remodeling.},

abstract = {Our understanding of early development in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is clouded by the scale at which the disease progresses; amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques, a hallmark feature of AD, are small (approximately 50 microm) and low contrast in diagnostic clinical imaging techniques. Diffraction enhanced imaging (DEI), a phase contrast x-ray imaging technique, has greater soft tissue contrast than conventional radiography and generates higher resolution images than magnetic resonance microimaging. Thus, in this proof of principle study, DEI in micro-CT mode was performed on the brains of AD-model mice to determine if DEI can visualize Abeta plaques. Results revealed small nodules in the cortex and hippocampus of the brain. Histology confirmed that the features seen in the DEI images of the brain were Abeta plaques. Several anatomical structures, including hippocampal subregions and white matter tracks, were also observed. Thus, DEI has strong promise in early diagnosis of AD, as well as general studies of the mouse brain.},

abstract = {Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray has great potential for its applications in both diagnosis and treatment of diseases, due to its characteristic properties including coherence, collimation, monochromaticity, and exceptional brightness. Great advances have been made regarding potential medical applications of SR X-ray in recent years, particularly with the development of the third generation of SR light sources. However, multiple studies have also suggested damaging effects of SR X-ray on biological samples ranging from protein crystals to cells and biological tissues. It has become increasingly important to conduct comprehensive studies on two closely related topics regarding SR X-ray in medical applications: The safety issues regarding the medical applications of SR X-ray and the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between SR X-ray and biological tissues. In this article, we attempted to provide an overview of the literatures regarding these two increasingly significant topics. We also proposed our hypothesis that there are significant differences between the biological tissue-damaging mechanisms of SR X-ray and those of normal X-ray, due to the characteristic properties of SR X-ray such as high dose rate. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, which may profoundly improve our understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between light and matter. These studies would also constitute an essential basis for establishing the safety standard for the medical applications of SR X-ray.},

abstract = {Wood, trabecular bone, coral, liquid foams, grains in polycrystals, igneous rock, and even many types of food share many structural similarities and belong to the general class called cellular materials. The visualization of these materials in 3D has been made possible in the last decades through a variety of imaging techniques including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), micro-computed X-ray tomography ($\mu$CT), and confocal microscopy. Recent advances in synchrotron-based ultra fast tomography have enabled measurements in liquid foams with thousands of bubbles and time resolutions down to 0.5 seconds. Post-processing techniques have, however, not kept pace and extracting useful physical metrics from such measurements is far from trivial. In this manuscript we present and validate a new, fully-automated method for segmenting and labeling the void space in cellular materials where the walls between cells are not visible or present. The individual cell labeling is based on a new tool, the Gradient Guided Watershed, which, while computationally simple, can be robustly scaled to large data-sets. Specifically we demonstrate the utility of this new method on several liquid foams (with varying liquid fraction and polydispersity) composed of thousands of bubbles, and the subsequent quantitative 3D structural characterization of those foams.},

abstract = {A high-resolution radiographic method for soft tissues in the small joints of the hand would aid in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), which often attacks these joints. Of particular interest would be imaging with {\textless}100 µm resolution the joint cartilage, whose integrity is a main indicator of disease. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) or refraction-based x-ray imaging with Talbot grating interferometers could provide such a method, since it enhances soft tissue contrast and can be implemented with conventional x-ray tubes. A numerical joint phantom was first developed to assess the angular sensitivity and spectrum needed for a hand DPC system. The model predicts that, due to quite similar refraction indexes for joint soft tissues, the refraction effects are very small, requiring high angular resolution. To compare our model to experiment we built a high-resolution bench-top interferometer using 10 µm period gratings, a W anode tube and a CCD-based detector. Imaging experiments on animal cartilage and on a human finger support the model predictions. For instance, the estimated difference between the index of refraction of cartilage and water is of only several percent at ∼25 keV mean energy, comparable to that between the linear attenuation coefficients. The potential advantage of DPC imaging thus comes mainly from the edge enhancement at the soft tissue interfaces. Experiments using a cadaveric human finger are also qualitatively consistent with the joint model, showing that refraction contrast is dominated by tendon embedded in muscle, with the cartilage layer difficult to observe in our conditions. Nevertheless, the model predicts that a DPC radiographic system for the small hand joints of the hand could be feasible using a low energy quasi-monochromatic source, such as a K-edge filtered Rh or Mo tube, in conjunction with a ∼2 m long 'symmetric' interferometer operated in a high Talbot order.},

abstract = {Prenatal heart valve interventions aiming at the early and systematic correction of congenital cardiac malformations represent a promising treatment option in maternal-fetal care. However, definite fetal valve replacements require growing implants adaptive to fetal and postnatal development. The presented study investigates the fetal implantation of prenatally engineered living autologous cell-based heart valves. Autologous amniotic fluid cells (AFCs) were isolated from pregnant sheep between 122 and 128 days of gestation via transuterine sonographic sampling. Stented trileaflet heart valves were fabricated from biodegradable PGA-P4HB composite matrices (n = 9) and seeded with AFCs in vitro. Within the same intervention, tissue engineered heart valves (TEHVs) and unseeded controls were implanted orthotopically into the pulmonary position using an in-utero closed-heart hybrid approach. The transapical valve deployments were successful in all animals with acute survival of 77.8{\%} of fetuses. TEHV in-vivo functionality was assessed using echocardiography as well as angiography. Fetuses were harvested up to 1 week after implantation representing a birth-relevant gestational age. TEHVs showed in vivo functionality with intact valvular integrity and absence of thrombus formation. The presented approach may serve as an experimental basis for future human prenatal cardiac interventions using fully biodegradable autologous cell-based living materials.},

abstract = {In x-ray computed tomography (CT), the most common parameter used to estimate and minimize patient dose is the CT dose index (CTDI). The CTDI is a volume-averaged measure that is used in situations where the table is incremented in conjunction with the tube rotation. Variants of the CTDI correct for averaging across the field of view and for adjacent beam overlaps or gaps. CTDI is usually measured with a pencil-shaped ionization chamber, although methods have been developed that use alternative detectors, including an optically stimulated luminescence probe and a solid-state real-time dosimeter. Because the CTDI represents an averaged dose to a homogeneous cylindrical phantom, the measurements are only an approximation of the patient dose. Furthermore, dose from interventional or perfusion CT, in which the table remains stationary between multiple scans, is best evaluated with point dose measurements made with small detectors. CTDI and point dose values are nearly the same for measurement of surface dose from spiral CT. However, for measurement of surface dose from perfusion CT, the dose is overestimated by a factor of two or more with CTDI values in comparison with point dose values. Both CTDI and point dose measurement are valuable for evaluating CT scanner output and estimating patient dose.},

abstract = {A fast, powerful and stable filter based on combined wavelet and Fourier analysis for the elimination of horizontal or vertical stripes in images is presented and compared with other types of destriping filters. Strict separation between artifacts and original features allowing both, suppression of the unwanted structures and high degree of preservation of the original image information is endeavoured. The results are validated by visual assessments, as well as by quantitative estimation of the image energy loss. The capabilities and the performance of the filter are tested on a number of case studies related to applications in tomographic imaging. The case studies include (i) suppression of waterfall artifacts in electron microscopy images based on focussed ion beam nanotomography, (ii) removal of different types of ring artifacts in synchrotron based X-ray microtomography and (iii) suppression of horizontal stripe artifacts from phase projections in grating interferometry.},

@article{eisner_air_2005,
abstract = {Ice cream is a complex multiphase system consisting of ice crystals, air cells and fat globules embedded in a high viscous freeze concentrated matrix phase. The microstructure of these constituents has significant impact on the consumer quality characteristics and its specific manipulation is of great interest. While in the frozen state the structure is dominated by the ice crystals after thawing the foam characteristics become important. Ice cream foam stability is correlated to the sensed creaminess and can be improved with smaller air cells and reduced coalescence. In contrast to the common approach addressing this goal by changed recipes this contribution proposes an additional process step which allows efficient dispersion of the air cells by high shear forces. Disruption of air cells by shear is efficiently done at high matrix viscosities, which are directly related to the amount of frozen water and therefore the temperature. Conventionally scraped surface heat exchangers (freezers) are used for whipping and freezing of an ice cream premix. With outlet temperature of -5 to -8 C these devices operate at relatively low ice cream viscosities. Here the ice cream is processed in a low temperature extruder {\{}(LTE){\}} after a classic freezer which cools it further to below -12 degrees C. This way shear forces exceeding those in the conventional system by 2-3 orders of magnitude can he applied, The maximum air cell diameter x(90.3) is reduced from 52 to 19 mu m. Beside the air structures the extrusion process induces also changes in the fat structures. High shear forces are also able to form an optimized network of agglomerated fat globules, which further stabilize.,, the foam, These structural changes have a significant impact on the foam related quality characteristics of ice cream its is proven by measurements, of the rheological behaviour during thawing and melt down tests.

abstract = {A significant improvement over conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging, which lacks contrast in small objects and soft biological tissues, is obtained by introducing phase-contrast imaging. As recently demonstrated, phase-contrast imaging is characterized by its extraordinary image quality, greatly enhanced contrast, and good soft tissue discrimination with very high spatial resolution down to the micron and even the sub-micron region. The rapid development of compact X-ray sources of high brightness, tuneability, and monochromaticity as well as high-resolution X-ray detectors with high quantum efficiency and improved computational methods is stimulating the development of a new generation of X-ray imaging systems for medical applications. The present paper reviews some intrinsic mechanisms, recent technical developments and potential medical applications of two-, three- and four-dimensional phase-contrast X-ray imaging. Challenging issues in current phase-contrast imaging techniques and key clinical applications are discussed and possible developments of future high-contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution medical X-ray imaging systems are outlined.},

@article{Lustig2007,
abstract = {The sparsity which is implicit in MR images is exploited to significantly undersample k-space. Some MR images such as angiograms are already sparse in the pixel representation; other, more complicated images have a sparse representation in some transform domain-for example, in terms of spatial finite-differences or their wavelet coefficients. According to the recently developed mathematical theory of compressed-sensing, images with a sparse representation can be recovered from randomly undersampled k-space data, provided an appropriate nonlinear recovery scheme is used. Intuitively, artifacts due to random undersampling add as noise-like interference. In the sparse transform domain the significant coefficients stand out above the interference. A nonlinear thresholding scheme can recover the sparse coefficients, effectively recovering the image itself. In this article, practical incoherent undersampling schemes are developed and analyzed by means of their aliasing interference. Incoherence is introduced by pseudo-random variable-density undersampling of phase-encodes. The reconstruction is performed by minimizing the l(1) norm of a transformed image, subject to data fidelity constraints. Examples demonstrate improved spatial resolution and accelerated acquisition for multislice fast spin-echo brain imaging and 3D contrast enhanced angiography.},

abstract = {We present in this study results from X-ray tomographic microscopy with synchrotron radiation performed both in attenuation and phase contrast modes on a limestone sample during two stages of water drying. No contrast agent was used in order to increase the X-ray attenuation by water. We show that only by using the phase contrast mode it is possible to achieve enough water content change resolution to investigate the drying process at the pore-scale. We performed 3D image analysis of the time-differential phase contrast tomogram. We show by the results of such analysis that it is possible to obtain a reliable characterization of the spatial redistribution of water in the resolved pore system in agreement with what expected from the theory of drying in porous media and from measurements performed with other approaches. We thus show the potential of X-ray phase contrast imaging for pore-scale investigations of reactive water transport processes which cannot be imaged by adding a contrast agent for exploiting the standard attenuation contrast imaging mode.},

@article{Tang2001a,
abstract = {The application of x-ray flat panel imagers (FPIs) in cone beam volume CT (CBVCT) has attracted increasing attention. However, due to a deficient semiconductor array manufacturing process, defective cells unavoidably exist in x-ray FPIs. These defective cells cause their corresponding image pixels in a projection image to behave abnormally in signal gray level, and result in severe streak and ring artifacts in a CBVCT image reconstructed from the projection images. Since a three-dimensional (3-D) back-projection is involved in CBVCT, the formation of the streak and ring artifacts is different from that in the two-dimensional (2-D) fan beam CT. In this paper, a geometric analysis of the abnormality propagation in the 3D back-projection is presented, and the morphology of the streak and ring artifacts caused by the abnormality propagation is investigated through both computer simulation and phantom studies. In order to calibrate those artifacts, a 2D wavelet-analysis-based statistical approach to correct the abnormal pixels is proposed. The approach consists of three steps: (1) the location-invariant defective cells in an x-ray FPI are recognized by applying 2-D wavelet analysis on flat-field images, and a comprehensive defective cell template is acquired; (2) based upon the template, the abnormal signal gray level of the projection image pixels corresponding to the location-invariant defective cells is replaced with the interpolation of that of their normal neighbor pixels; (3) that corresponding to the isolated location-variant defective cells are corrected using a narrow-windowed median filter. The CBVCT images of a CT low-contrast phantom are employed to evaluate this proposed approach, showing that the streak and ring artifacts can be reliably eliminated. The novelty and merit of the approach are the incorporation of the wavelet analysis whose intrinsic multi-resolution analysis and localizability make the recognition algorithm robust under variable x-ray exposure levels between 30{\%} and 70{\%} of the dynamic range of an x-ray FPI},

Alveolar ductal tree is formed by these order-2 polyhedra. Equilibrium and elasticity require the alveolar mouths to be curved and convex toward the alveolar wall. Perforation of additional walls causes a variety of alveolar shapes. The predicted shapes of the alveoli, the shapes of alveolar mouths, the lengths of sacs and ducts, the statistics of the dihedral angles, stars, corners, lines, dots, and vertices compare well with available morphometric data. The vascular and bronchial trees are joined at the alveolar level: each arteriole supplies 0.75 and each venule drains 0.72 order-2 polyhedra.},

abstract = {It is not currently known whether central hemodynamic or peripheral (vascular or metabolic) factors limit maximal oxygen uptake. By measuring the blood flow and oxygen uptake of exercising muscles when only a small fraction of the total muscle mass is engaged In exercise, it has been demonstrated that the skeletal muscle of man could accommodate a blood flow of at least 200 ml/100 g min, and consume 300 ml 02/100 g min at exhaustive exercise. Thus, in whole body exercise the limiting factor is the capacity of the heart to deliver oxygen, not the muscle. It has also been observed that at high perfusion of the muscle the arteriovenous 02 difference is small (14 to 15 vol {\%}), and that the low extraction of oxygen is related to the mean transit time (MTT) of red blood cells passing through the capillaries. It has been concluded that the primary importance of enlargement of the capillary bed with endurance training Is not to accommodate flow but to maintain or elongate MTT. It has also been concluded that, in whole body exercise, the capacity of the muscles to receive a flow exceeds by a factor of 2 to 3 the capacity of the heart to supply the flow. Thus, vasoconstrictor tone must also be present in the arteries that “feed” exercising muscles.},

abstract = {In pulmonary emphysema, the alveolar structure progressively breaks down via a three-dimensional (3D) process that leads to airspace enlargement. The characterization of such structural changes has, however, been based on measurements from two-dimensional (2D) tissue sections or estimates of 3D structure from 2D measurements. In this study, we developed a novel silver staining method for visualizing tissue structure in 3D using micro-computed tomographic (CT) imaging, which showed that at 30 cmH20 fixing pressure, the mean alveolar airspace volume increased from 0.12 nl in normal mice to 0.44 nl and 2.14 nl in emphysematous mice, respectively, at 7 and 14 days following elastase-induced injury. We also assessed tissue structure in 2D using laser scanning confocal microscopy. The mean of the equivalent diameters of the alveolar airspaces was lower in 2D compared with 3D, while its variance was higher in 2D than in 3D in all groups. However, statistical comparisons of alveolar airspace size from normal and emphysematous mice yielded similar results in 2D and 3D: compared with control, both the mean and variance of the equivalent diameters increased by 7 days after treatment. These indexes further increased from day 7 to day 14 following treatment. During the first 7 days following treatment, the relative change in SD increased at a much faster rate compared with the relative change in mean equivalent diameter. We conclude that quantifying heterogeneity in structure can provide new insight into the pathogenesis or progression of emphysema that is enhanced by improved sensitivity using 3D measurements.},

Quantum yields have been measured for samples up to 30 cm in length using photomultiplier tubes, wavelength shifters, and silicon photodiodes. A study has also been made of the scintillation properties of undoped CsI. It is found that the light output and decay time of the 310-nm fast component increases and the emission spectrum shifts to longer wavelengths at lower temperatures. The effects on the optical transmission and scintillation light output due to radiation damage from 60Co gamma rays have been measured for doses up to {\~{}}106 rad. It is found that the radiation resistance of undoped CsI is substantially higher than has been reported for thallium-doped CsI},

abstract = {The alveolated structure of the pulmonary acinus plays a vital role in gas exchange function. Three-dimensional (3D) analysis of the parenchymal region is fundamental to understanding this structure-function relationship, but only a limited number of attempts have been conducted in the past because of technical limitations. In this study, we developed a new image processing methodology based on finite element (FE) analysis for accurate 3D structural reconstruction of the gas exchange regions of the lung. Stereologically well characterized rat lung samples (Pediatr Res 53: 72-80, 2003) were imaged using high-resolution synchrotron radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy. A stack of 1,024 images (each slice: 1024 x 1024 pixels) with resolution of 1.4 mum(3) per voxel were generated. For the development of FE algorithm, regions of interest (ROI), containing approximately 7.5 million voxels, were further extracted as a working subunit. 3D FEs were created overlaying the voxel map using a grid-based hexahedral algorithm. A proper threshold value for appropriate segmentation was iteratively determined to match the calculated volume density of tissue to the stereologically determined value (Pediatr Res 53: 72-80, 2003). The resulting 3D FEs are ready to be used for 3D structural analysis as well as for subsequent FE computational analyses like fluid dynamics and skeletonization.},

abstract = {Defining the healthy human airway is important in enhancing our understanding of pulmonary disease states such as inflammation and cancer. The structure of the human airway, both static and dynamic, can be assessed using multi-detector CT (MDCT) scanning. This modality also allows for the evaluation of structures outside of the airway. The airway wall can be directly visualized using CCD chip high-resolution color optical imaging through endoscopy allowing bronchial wall evaluation by traditional biopsy methods, as well as by newer optically based strategies. We suggest that these two imaging modalities, MDCT and optical imaging, provide complementary information about the normal airway, and the airway in various diseases. Methods for evaluating the human airway using MDCT images are presented facilitating automatic airway segmentation, branchpoint finding and airway dimension analysis. The airway wall color is objectively evaluated as an important surrogate for airway wall inflammation and cancer formation, and the integration of the color endoscopic information into the MDCT scan data set is currently ongoing. The amalgamation of these two digital imaging modalities appears increasingly useful for enabling biopsy techniques, and for relating structure and function of the airway. In addition, these developments may be progressively more useful in understanding the normal airway structure and function, for defining airway diseases patterns and for guiding biopsy and therapeutic procedures.},

To date, very little is known about the distribution of natural gas hydrates in sedimentary matrices and its influence on the seismic properties of the host rock, in particular at low hydrate concentration. Digital rock physics offers a unique approach to this issue yet requires good quality, high-resolution 3-D representations for the accurate modeling of petrophysical and transport properties. Although such models are readily available via in situ synchrotron radiation X-ray tomography, the analysis of such data asks for complex workflows and high computational power to maintain valuable results. Here, we present a best-practice procedure complementing data from Chaouachi et al. (2015) with data post-processing, including image enhancement and segmentation as well as exemplary numerical simulations of an acoustic wave propagation in 3-D using the derived results. A combination of the tomography and 3-D modeling opens a path to a more reliable deduction of properties of gas hydrate-bearing sediments without a reliance on idealized and frequently imprecise models.},

abstract = {A model lung tumor system has been developed in mice for the evaluation of vascular targeted radioimmunotherapy. In this model, EMT-6 mammary carcinoma tumors growing in the lung are treated with 213Bi, an alpha particle emitter, which is targeted to lung blood vessels using a monoclonal antibody. Smaller tumors ({\textless} 100 microm in diameter) are cured, but larger tumors undergo a period of regression and then regrow and ultimately prove lethal. The goal of this work was to determine if external imaging with MRI or CT could be used routinely to monitor the growth/ regression of lung tumors in live mice. To attempt to evaluate individual tumors in vivo, animals were initially imaged with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). High resolution MRI images could be obtained only after sacrifice when lungs were not moving. In contrast, high resolution computed tomography (CT) produced evaluable images from anesthetized animals. Serial CT images (up to 5/animal) were collected over a 17 day period of tumor growth and treatment. When tumored animals became moribund, animals were sacrificed and lungs were inflated with fixative, embedded in paraffin, and then sectioned serially to compare the detection of tumors by high resolution CT with detection by histology. CT proved most useful in detecting lung tumors located in the hilar area and least useful in detecting serosal surface and anterior lobe tumor foci. Overall, CT images of live animals revealed tumors in approximately 2/3 of cases detected in histologic serial sections when relatively few tumors were present per lung. Detection of lesions and their resolution post therapy were complicated due to residual hemorrhagic, regressing tumor nodules and the development of lung edema both of which appeared as high density areas in the CT scans. We conclude that the microCT method used could identify some lung tumors as small as 100 microm in diameter; however, no concrete evaluation of therapy induced regression of the tumors could be made with CT analyses alone.},

We used design-based stereological methods to estimate the number of alveoli (N(alv)) in male and female rhesus monkeys over the first 7 yr of life. Twenty-six rhesus monkeys (13 males ranging in age from 4 to 1,920 days and lung volumes from 41.7 to 602 cm(3), 13 females ranging in age from 22 to 2,675 days and lung volumes from 43.5 to 380 cm(3)) were necropsied and lungs fixed, isotropically oriented, fractionated, sampled, embedded, and sectioned for alveolar counting. Parenchymal, alveolar, alveolar duct core air, and interalveolar septal tissue volumes increased rapidly during the first 2 yr with slowed growth from 2 to 7 yr. The rate of change was greater in males than females. N(alv) also showed consistent growth throughout the study, with increases in N(alv) best predicted by increases in lung volume. However, mean alveolar volume showed little relationship with age, lung volume, or body weight but was larger in females and showed a greater size distribution than in males. Alveoli increase in number but not volume throughout postnatal development in rhesus monkeys.},

abstract = {Biological soft tissues are almost transparent to hard X rays and therefore cannot be investigated without enhancement with a contrast medium, such as iodine. On the other hand, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is sensitive to light elements (1-8). This is because the X-ray phase shift cross section is almost thousand times larger than the X-ray absorption cross section for light elements such as hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen (4,5). Hence, phase-contrast X-ray imaging is a promising technique for observing the structure inside biological soft tissues without the need for staining and without serious radiation exposure. We have devised a means of observing biological tissues in three dimensions using a novel X-ray computed tomography (CT) by modifying the phase-contrast technique. To generate appropriate CT input data, we used phase-mapping images obtained using an X-ray interferometer (6) and computer analysis of interference patterns (9). Now, we present a three-dimensional observation result of a nonstained sample of a cancerous rabbit liver, using a synchrotron X-ray source. Phase-contrast X-ray CT was able to clearly differentiate the cancer lesion from the normal tissue. Moreover, fine structures corresponding to cancerous degeneration and fibrous tissues were clearly depicted.},

abstract = {The number of alveoli is a key structural determinant of lung architecture. A design-based stereologic approach was used for the direct and unbiased estimation of alveolar number in the human lung. The principle is based on two-dimensional topology in three-dimensional space and is free of assumptions on the shape, size, or spatial orientation of alveoli. Alveolar number is estimated by counting their openings at the level of the free septal edges, where they form a two-dimensional network. Mathematically, the Euler number of this network is estimated using physical disectors at a light microscopic level. In six adult human lungs, the mean alveolar number was 480 million (range: 274-790 million; coefficient of variation: 37{\%}). Alveolar number was closely related to total lung volume, with larger lungs having considerably more alveoli. The mean size of a single alveolus was rather constant with 4.2 x 10(6) microm3 (range: 3.3-4.8 x 10(6) microm3; coefficient of variation: 10{\%}), irrespective of the lung size. One cubic millimeter lung parenchyma would then contain around 170 alveoli. The method proved to be very efficient and easy to apply in practice. Future applications will show this approach to be an important addition to design-based stereologic methods for the quantitative analysis of lung structure.},

The lung cancer epidemic can be largely explained by environmental agents; cigarette smoking was identified as its predominant cause in the 1960s. Subsequently, research has progressed to focus on other environmental and genetic factors, emphasizing those that could affect lung cancer risk in smokers. The potential influence of diet on lung cancer risk has been a topic of considerable interest since the 1970s.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of X-rays over a century ago the techniques applied to the engineering of X-ray sources have remained relatively unchanged. From the inception of thermionic electron sources, which, due to simplicity of fabrication, remain central to almost all X-ray applications, there have been few fundamental technological advances. However, with the emergence of ever more demanding medical and inspection techniques, including computed tomography and tomosynthesis, security inspection, high throughput manufacturing and radiotherapy, has resulted in a considerable level of interest in the development of new fabrication methods. The use of conventional thermionic sources is limited by their slow temporal response and large physical size. In response, field electron emission has emerged as a promising alternative means of deriving a highly controllable electron beam of a well-defined distribution. When coupled to the burgeoning field of nanomaterials, and in particular, carbon nanotubes, such systems present a unique technological opportunity. This review provides a summary of the current state-of-the-art in carbon nanotube-based field emission X-ray sources. We detail the various fabrication techniques and functional advantages associated with their use, including the ability to produce ever smaller electron beam assembles, shaped cathodes, enhanced temporal stability and emergent fast-switching pulsed sources. We conclude with an overview of some of the commercial progress made towards the realisation of an innovative and disruptive technology.},

We are experimenting with a prototype VCT scanner that uses flat-panel X-ray detectors and is designed for high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging. Using this technique, we have demonstrated microangiography of xeno-transplanted skin squamous cell carcinomas in nude mice. VCT shows the vessel architecture of tumors and animals with greater detail and plasticity than has previously been achieved, and is superior to contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) angiography. VCT and MR images correlate well for larger tumor vessels, which are tracked from their origin on 3D reconstructions of VCT images. When compared with histology, small tumor vessels with a diameter as small as 50 microm were clearly visualized. Furthermore, imaging small vessel networks inside the tumor tissue improved discrimination of vital and necrotic regions. Thus, VCT substantially improves imaging of vascularization in tumors and offers a promising tool for preclinical studies of tumor angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapies.},

abstract = {Understanding the influence of bubble foams on magma permeability and strength is critical to investigations of volcanic eruption mechanisms. Increasing foam porosity decreases strength, enhancing the probability of an eruption. However, higher porosities lead to larger permeabilities, which can lessen the eruption hazard. Here we measure bubble size and wall thickness distributions, as well as connectivity, and calculate permeabilities and tensile strengths of basaltic foams imaged by synchrotron X-ray tomographic microscopy during bubble growth in hydrated basaltic melts. Rapid vesiculation produces porous foams whose fragmentation thresholds are only 5-6 MPa and whose permeabilities increase from approximately 1×10(-10) to 1×10(-9) m(2) between 10 and 14 s despite decreasing connectivity between bubbles. These results indicate that basaltic magmas are most susceptible to failure immediately upon vesiculation and at later times, perhaps only 10's of seconds later, permeability increases may lessen the hazard of explosive, basaltic, Plinian eruptions.},

abstract = {The visualization of the vascular network in tumors down to the smallest vessels requires high spatial resolution and reasonable contrast. Stained corrosion casts of the microvasculature network guarantee superior X-ray absorption contrast and highest reproduction fidelity. Tomography of a centimeter-size tumor, however, is unfeasible at the spatial resolution needed to reveal the smallest vessels. Therefore, local tomography has been performed to visualize the smallest capillaries within the region of interest. These three-dimensional data show the detailed morphology, but the reconstructed absorption coefficients obtained in local tomography differ substantially from the absorption coefficients retrieved from the less detailed global tomography data. This paper deals with the adaptation of local tomography data using the global data and considers two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs, sinogram extension, and multi-parameter cupping correction. It is demonstrated that two-parameter histogram matching of the radiographs already provides reasonable agreement. The change of the lens in front of the detector's camera, however, significantly affects the obtained local X-ray absorption coefficients in the tomograms predominantly owing to the dissimilar point-spread functions of the two configurations used, and much less to the fact that one of the data sets was acquired in a local geometry.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
While there is agreement that exercise is a powerful stimulus to increase both mitochondrial function and content, we do not know the optimal training stimulus to maximise improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis. 

SCOPE OF REVIEW
This review will focus predominantly on the effects of exercise on mitochondrial function and content, as there is a greater volume of published research on these adaptations and stronger conclusions can be made. 

MAJOR CONCLUSIONS
The results of cross-sectional studies, as well as training studies involving rats and humans, suggest that training intensity may be an important determinant of improvements in mitochondrial function (as determined by mitochondrial respiration), but not mitochondrial content (as assessed by citrate synthase activity). In contrast, it appears that training volume, rather than training intensity, may be an important determinant of exercise-induced improvements in mitochondrial content. Exercise-induced mitochondrial adaptations are quickly reversed following a reduction or cessation of physical activity, highlighting that skeletal muscle is a remarkably plastic tissue. Due to the small number of studies, more research is required to verify the trends highlighted in this review, and further studies are required to investigate the effects of different types of training on the mitochondrial sub-populations and also mitochondrial adaptations in different fibre types. Further research is also required to better understand how genetic variants influence the large individual variability for exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial biogenesis. 

GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE
The importance of mitochondria for both athletic performance and health underlines the importance of better understanding the factors that regulate exercise-induced changes in mitochondrial biogenesis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled Frontiers of Mitochondrial Research.},

abstract = {Non-bone in vivo micro-CT imaging has many potential applications for preclinical evaluation. Specifically, the in vivo quantification of changes in the vascular network and organ morphology in small animals, associated with the emergence and progression of diseases like bone fracture, inflammation and cancer, would be critical to the development and evaluation of new therapies for the same. However, there are few published papers describing the in vivo vascular imaging in small animals, due to technical challenges, such as low image quality and low vessel contrast in surrounding tissues. These studies have primarily focused on lung, cardiovascular and brain imaging. In vivo vascular imaging of mouse hind limbs has not been reported. We have developed an in vivo CT imaging technique to visualize and quantify vasculature and organ structure in disease models, with the goal of improved quality images. With 1-2 minutes scanning by a high speed in vivo micro-CT scanner (Quantum CT), and injection of a highly efficient contrast agent (Exitron nano 12000), vasculature and organ structure were semi-automatically segmented and quantified via image analysis software (Analyze). Vessels of the head and hind limbs, and organs like the heart, liver, kidneys and spleen were visualized and segmented from density maps. In a mouse model of bone metastasis, neoangiogenesis was observed, and associated changes to vessel morphology were computed, along with associated enlargement of the spleen. The in vivo CT image quality, voxel size down to 20 $\mu$m, is sufficient to visualize and quantify mouse vascular morphology. With this technique, in vivo vascular monitoring becomes feasible for the preclinical evaluation of small animal disease models.},

abstract = {The physical requirements for tomographic imaging with x-ray photons and energetic ions beams are reviewed and some illustrative applications are briefly described. The number of x-ray photons needed to produce tomographic images of a given quality in terms of spatial and density resolution is shown to be independent of object size. Consequently high resolution microtomography requires very intense sources of photons. The performance of microtomography imaging systems based on synchrotron light sources and microfocus x-ray tubes is intercompared and the latter are found to be surprisingly competitive. For objects smaller than a few hundred microns microtomography with MeV ion beams has been developed in recent years and sub-micron resolution demonstrated. For a given image quality ion beam tomography requires substantially lower fluxes than is the case with photon beams but despite this the absorbed doses are similar, being as high as 105 Gy for 1 [mu]m resolution on a 100 [mu]m sample.},

abstract = {Synchrotron-based microtomographic devices are powerful, non-destructive, high-resolution research tools. Highly brilliant and coherent X-rays extend the traditional absorption imaging techniques and enable edge-enhanced and phase-sensitive measurements. At the Materials Science Beamline MS of the Swiss Light Source (SLS), the X-ray microtomographic device is now operative. A high performance detector based on a scintillating screen optically coupled to a CCD camera has been developed and tested. Different configurations are available, covering a field of view ranging from 715x715 [mu]m2 to 7.15x7.15 mm2 with magnifications from 4x to 40x. With the highest magnification 480 lp/mm had been achieved at 10{\%} modulation transfer function which corresponds to a spatial resolution of 1.04 [mu]m. A low-noise fast-readout CCD camera transfers 2048x2048 pixels within 100-250 ms at a dynamic range of 12-14 bit to the file server. A user-friendly graphical interface gives access to the main parameters needed for running a complete tomographic scan. This novel device will be used to study the physical structure and chemical composition of biological and technical materials, e.g. enabling pseudo-dynamic testing of bone samples to establish structure-function relationships in simulated osteoporosis or enabling non-destructive testing during the development of modern composite materials.},

This paper presents an efficient parallel thinning algorithm which produces either curve skeletons or surface skeletons from 3D binary objects. It is important that a curve skeleton is extracted directly (i.e., without creating a surface skeleton). The strategy which is used is called directional: each iteration step is composed of a number of subiterations each of which can be executed in parallel. One iteration step of the proposed algorithm contains 12 subiterations instead of the usual six. The algorithm makes easy implementation possible, since deletable points are given by 3x3x3 matching templates. The topological correctness for (26, 6) binary pictures is proved.},

abstract = {Synchrotron radiation phase-contrast X-ray tomographic microscopy (srPCXTM) was applied to observation and identification of the features of spruce anatomy at the cellular lengthscale. The pilot experiments presented in the paper clearly revealed the features of the heartwood of Spruce (Picea abies [L.] Karst.), such as lumina and pits connecting the lumina, with a theoretical voxel size of 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.7 microm(3). The experiments were carried out on microspecimens of heartwood, measuring approximately 200 by 200 micrometers in cross-section. The technique for production and preparation of wood microsamples was developed within the framework of this investigation. The total porosity of the samples was derived and the values of the microstructural parameters, such as the diameters of tracheid, cell wall thicknesses and pit diameters were assessed non-invasively. Microstructural features as thin/small as approximately 1.5 microm were revealed and reconstructed in 3D. It is suggested that the position of sub-voxel-sized features (such as position of tori in the bordered pit pairs) can be determined indirectly using watershed segmentation. Moreover, the paper discusses the practical issues connected with a pipelined phase-contrast synchrotron-based microtomography experiment and the possible future potentials of this technique in the domain of wood science.},

In this paper, we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm for DPCI-CT which benefits from the new compressed sensing theory. We first realize a differential algebraic reconstruction technique (DART) by discretizing the projection process of the differential phase contrast imaging into a linear partial derivative matrix. In this way the compressed sensing reconstruction problem of DPCI reconstruction can be transformed to a resolved problem in the transmission imaging CT. Our algorithm has the potential to reconstruct the refraction index distribution of the sample from highly undersampled projection data. Thus it can significantly reduce the dose and inspection time. The proposed algorithm has been validated by numerical simulations and actual experiments.},

Here, we demonstrate the imaging of airways, blood vessels, and parenchyma from whole, optically cleared mouse lung lobes with a resolution down to the level of single alveoli using absorption and autofluorescence scan modes. The internal structure of the lung can then be analyzed nondestructively and quantitatively in three-dimensional datasets in any preferred planar orientation. Moreover, the procedure preserves the microscopic structure of the lung and allows for subsequent correlative histologic studies. In summary, the current study has shown that SLOT is a valuable technique to study the internal structure of the mouse lung.},

@article{Kerbel2015a,
abstract = {The clinical circumstance of treating spontaneous metastatic disease, after resection of primary tumors, whether advanced/overt or microscopic in nature, is seldom modeled in mice and may be a major factor in explaining the frequent discordance between preclinical and clinical therapeutic outcomes where the trend is "overprediction" of positive results in preclinical mouse model studies. To evaluate this hypothesis, a research program was initiated a decade ago to develop multiple models of metastasis in mice, using variants of human tumor cell lines selected in vivo for enhanced spontaneous metastatic aggressiveness after surgical resection of established orthotopic primary tumors. These models have included breast, renal, and colorectal carcinomas; ovarian cancer (but without prior surgery); and malignant melanoma. They have been used primarily for experimental therapeutic investigations involving various antiangiogenic drugs alone or with chemotherapy, especially "metronomic" low-dose chemotherapy. The various translational studies undertaken have revealed a number of clinically relevant findings. These include the following: (i) the potential of metronomic chemotherapy, especially when combined with a vascular endothelial growth factor pathway targeting drug to successfully treat advanced metastatic disease; (ii) the development of relapsed spontaneous brain metastases in mice with melanoma or breast cancer whose systemic metastatic disease is successfully controlled for a period with a given therapy; (iii) foreshadowing the failure of adjuvant antiangiogenic drug-based phase III trials; (iv) recapitulating the failure of oral antiangiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitors plus standard chemotherapy in contrast to the modest successes of antiangiogenic antibodies plus chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer; and (v) revealing "vessel co-option" and absence of angiogenesis as a determinant of intrinsic resistance or minimal responsiveness to antiangiogenic therapy in lung metastases. Developing similar models of metastatic disease but involving mouse tumors grown in syngeneic immunocompetent mice may also prove useful for future translational studies of immune therapy-based treatments.},

abstract = {Abnormalities in the cerebrovascular system play a central role in many neurologic diseases. The on-going expansion of rodent models of human cerebrovascular diseases and the need to use these models to understand disease progression and treatment has amplified the need for reproducible non-invasive imaging methods for high-resolution visualization of the complete cerebral vasculature. In this study, we present methods for in vivo high-resolution (19 $\mu$m isotropic) computed tomography imaging of complete mouse brain vasculature. This technique enabled 3D visualization of large cerebrovascular networks, including the Circle of Willis. Blood vessels as small as 40 $\mu$m were clearly delineated. ACTA2 mutations in humans cause cerebrovascular defects, including abnormally straightened arteries and a moyamoya-like arteriopathy characterized by bilateral narrowing of the internal carotid artery and stenosis of many large arteries. In vivo imaging studies performed in a mouse model of Acta2 mutations demonstrated the utility of this method for studying vascular morphometric changes that are practically impossible to identify using current histological methods. Specifically, the technique demonstrated changes in the width of the Circle of Willis, straightening of cerebral arteries and arterial stenoses. We believe the use of imaging methods described here will contribute substantially to the study of rodent cerebrovasculature.},

abstract = {Volumetric data at micrometer level resolution can be acquired within a few minutes using synchrotron-radiation-based tomographic microscopy. The field of view along the rotation axis of the sample can easily be increased by stacking several tomograms, allowing the investigation of long and thin objects at high resolution. On the contrary, an extension of the field of view in the perpendicular direction is non-trivial. This paper presents an acquisition protocol which increases the field of view of the tomographic dataset perpendicular to its rotation axis. The acquisition protocol can be tuned as a function of the reconstruction quality and scanning time. Since the scanning time is proportional to the radiation dose imparted to the sample, this method can be used to increase the field of view of tomographic microscopy instruments while optimizing the radiation dose for radiation-sensitive samples and keeping the quality of the tomographic dataset on the required level. This approach, dubbed wide-field synchrotron radiation tomographic microscopy, can increase the lateral field of view up to five times. The method has been successfully applied for the three-dimensional imaging of entire rat lung acini with a diameter of 4.1 mm at a voxel size of 1.48 microm.},

abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. A total of 1,596,670 new cancer cases and 571,950 deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in 2011. Overall cancer incidence rates were stable in men in the most recent time period after decreasing by 1.9{\%} per year from 2001 to 2005; in women, incidence rates have been declining by 0.6{\%} annually since 1998. Overall cancer death rates decreased in all racial/ethnic groups in both men and women from 1998 through 2007, with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Native women, in whom rates were stable. African American and Hispanic men showed the largest annual decreases in cancer death rates during this time period (2.6{\%} and 2.5{\%}, respectively). Lung cancer death rates showed a significant decline in women after continuously increasing since the 1930s. The reduction in the overall cancer death rates since 1990 in men and 1991 in women translates to the avoidance of about 898,000 deaths from cancer. However, this progress has not benefitted all segments of the population equally; cancer death rates for individuals with the least education are more than twice those of the most educated. The elimination of educational and racial disparities could potentially have avoided about 37{\%} (60,370) of the premature cancer deaths among individuals aged 25 to 64 years in 2007 alone. Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population with an emphasis on those groups in the lowest socioeconomic bracket.

abstract = {Analysis of tomographic datasets at synchrotron light sources (including X-ray transmission tomography, X-ray fluorescence microscopy and X-ray diffraction tomography) is becoming progressively more challenging due to the increasing data acquisition rates that new technologies in X-ray sources and detectors enable. The next generation of synchrotron facilities that are currently under design or construction throughout the world will provide diffraction-limited X-ray sources and are expected to boost the current data rates by several orders of magnitude, stressing the need for the development and integration of efficient analysis tools. Here an attempt to provide a collaborative framework for the analysis of synchrotron tomographic data that has the potential to unify the effort of different facilities and beamlines performing similar tasks is described in detail. The proposed Python-based framework is open-source, platform- and data-format-independent, has multiprocessing capability and supports procedural programming that many researchers prefer. This collaborative platform could affect all major synchrotron facilities where new effort is now dedicated to developing new tools that can be deployed at the facility for real-time processing, as well as distributed to users for off-site data processing.},

abstract = {The recently developed technique of lung morphometry using hyperpolarized 3He diffusion magnetic resonance (MR) (Yablonskiy DA, Sukstanskii AL, Woods JC, Gierada DS, Quirk JD, Hogg JC, Cooper JD, Conradi MS. J Appl Physiol 107:1258-1265, 2009) permits in vivo study of lung microstructure at the alveolar level. Originally proposed for human lungs, it also has the potential to study small animals. The technique relies on theoretical developments in the area of gas diffusion in lungs linking the diffusion attenuated MR signal to the lung microstructure. To adapt this technique to small animals, certain modifications in MR protocol and data analysis are required, reflecting the smaller size of mouse alveoli and acinar airways. This is the subject of the present paper. Herein, we established empirical relationships relating diffusion measurements to geometrical parameters of lung acinar airways with dimensions typical for mice and rats by using simulations of diffusion in the airways. We have also adjusted the MR protocol to acquire data with much shorter diffusion times compared with humans to accommodate the substantially smaller acinar airway length. We apply this technique to study mouse lungs ex vivo. Our MR-based measurements yield mean values of lung surface-to-volume ratio of 670 cm-1, alveolar density of 3,200 per mm3, alveolar depth of 55 $\mu$m, and mean chord length of 62 $\mu$m, all consistent with published data obtained histologically in mice by unbiased methods. The proposed technique can be used for in vivo experiments, opening a door for longitudinal studies of lung morphometry in mice and other small animals. {\textcopyright} 2010 the American Physiological Society.},

An acinus is defined as the small tree of gas-exchanging airways, which is fed by the most distal purely conducting airway. Until now a dissector of five consecutive sections or airway casts were used to count acini. We developed a faster method to estimate the number of acini in young adult rats. Right middle lung lobes were critical point dried or paraffin embedded after heavy metal staining and imaged by X-ray micro-CT or synchrotron radiation-based X-rays tomographic microscopy. The entrances of the acini were counted in three-dimensional (3D) stacks of images by scrolling through them and using morphological criteria (airway wall thickness and appearance of alveoli). Segmentation stopper were placed at the acinar entrances for 3D visualizations of the conducting airways. We observed that acinar airways start at various generations and that one transitional bronchiole may serve more than one acinus. A mean of 5612 (±547) acini per lung and a mean airspace volume of 0.907 (±0.108) $\mu$L per acinus were estimated. In 60-day-old rats neither the number of acini nor the mean acinar volume did correlate with the body weight or the lung volume.},

Although this transition is irreversible, it carries potential for several robotic applications. Here, we examine relevant characteristics of three types of ker-nels including expansion ratio, transition temperature, popping force, compression strength, and biodegradability. We test the viability of popping by hot oil, hot air, microwaves, and direct contact with heated Nichrome wire. As kernels can change from regular to (larger) irregular shapes, we examine the change in inter-granular friction and propose their use as granular fluids in jamming actuators, without the need for a vacuum pump. Furthermore, as a proof-of-concept, we also demonstrate the use of popcorn-driven actuation in soft, compliant, and rigid-link grippers. Serving as a first introduction of popcorn into robotics, we hope this paper will inspire novel mechanisms for multi-functional designs.},

abstract = {Abstract  Morphological variation in marine sessile organisms is frequently related to environmental factors. Quantifying such variation is relevant in a range of ecological studies. For example, analyzing the growth form of fossil organisms may indicate the state of the physical environment in which the organism lived. A quantitative morphological comparison is important in studies where marine sessile organisms are transplanted from one environment to another. This study presents a method for the quantitative analysis of three-dimensional (3D) images of scleractinian corals obtained with X-ray Computed Tomography scanning techniques. The advantage of Computed Tomography scanning is that a full 3D image of a complex branching object, including internal structures, can be obtained with a very high precision. There are several complications in the analysis of this data set. In the analysis of a complex branching object, landmark-based methods usually do not work and different approaches are required where various artifacts (for example cavities, holes in the skeleton, scanning artifacts, etc.) in the data set have to be removed before the analysis. A method is presented, which is based on the construction of a medial axis and a combination of image-processing techniques for the analysis of a 3D image of a complex branching object where the complications mentioned above can be overcome. The method is tested on a range of 3D images of samples of the branching scleractinian coral Madracis mirabilis collected at different depths. It is demonstrated that the morphological variation of these samples can be quantified, and that biologically relevant morphological characteristics, like branch-spacing and surface/volume ratios, can be computed.},

@article{Woodward2005,
abstract = {To elucidate the shape, size, and spatial arrangement and association of the terminal respiratory units of the avian lung, a three-dimensional (3D) computer-aided voxel reconstruction was generated from serial plastic sections of the lung of the adult muscovy duck, Cairina moschata. The air capillaries (ACs) are rather rotund structures that interconnect via short, narrow passageways, and the blood capillaries (BCs) comprise proliferative segments of rather uniform dimensions. The ACs and BCs anastomose profusely and closely intertwine with each other, forming a complex network. The two sets of respiratory units are, however, absolutely not mirror images of each other, as has been claimed by some investigators. Historically, the terms 'air capillaries' and 'blood capillaries' were derived from observations that the exchange tissue of the avian lung mainly consisted of a network of minuscule air- and vascular units. The entrenched notion that the ACs are straight (non-branching), blind-ending tubules that project outwards from the parabronchial lumen and that the BCs are direct tubules that run inwards parallel to and in contact with the ACs is overly simplistic, misleading and incorrect. The exact architectural properties of the respiratory units of the avian lung need to be documented and applied in formulating reliable physiological models. A few ostensibly isolated ACs were identified. The mechanism through which such units form and their functional significance, if any, are currently unclear.},

abstract = {Helical computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive imaging modality for detection of pulmonary nodules. However, a single CT examination produces a large quantity of image data. Therefore, a computerized scheme has been developed to automatically detect pulmonary nodules on CT images. This scheme includes both two- and three-dimensional analyses. Within each section, gray-level thresholding methods are used to segment the thorax from the background and then the lungs from the thorax. A rolling ball algorithm is applied to the lung segmentation contours to avoid the loss of juxtapleural nodules. Multiple gray-level thresholds are applied to the volumetric lung regions to identify nodule candidates. These candidates represent both nodules and normal pulmonary structures. For each candidate, two- and three-dimensional geometric and gray-level features are computed. These features are merged with linear discriminant analysis to reduce the number of candidates that correspond to normal structures. This method was applied to a 17-case database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the automated classifier. Results yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 in the task of classifying candidates detected during thresholding as nodules or nonnodules.},

In principle, it can be used for meshing any geometry with hexahedral elements and examples of meshes for geometries arising from various applications are given.

abstract = {Recognition of abnormalities related to the lobular anatomy has become increasingly important in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of lung abnormalities at clinical routines of CT examinations. This paper aims a 3-D microstructural analysis of the pulmonary acinus with isotropic spatial resolution in the range of several micrometers by using micro CT. Previously, we demonstrated the ability of synchrotron radiation micro CT (SR$\mu$CT) using offset scan mode in microstructural analysis of the whole part of the secondary pulmonary lobule. In this paper, we present a semiautomatic method to segment the acinar and subacinar airspaces from the secondary pulmonary lobule and to track small vessels running inside alveolar walls in human acinus imaged by the SR$\mu$CT. The method beains with and segmentation of the tissues such as pleural surface, interlobular septa, alveola wall, or vessel using a threshold technique and 3-D connected component analysis. 3-D air space are then conustructed separated by tissues and represented branching patterns of airways and airspaces distal to the terminal bronchiole. A graph-partitioning approach isolated acini whose stems are interactively defined as the terminal bronchiole in the secondary pulmonary lobule. Finally, we performed vessel tracking using a non-linear sate space which captures both smoothness of the trajectories and intensity coherence along vessel orientations. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can extract several acinar airspaces from the 3-D SR$\mu$CT image of secondary pulmonary lobule and that the extracted acinar airspace enable an accurate quantitative description of the anatomy of the human acinus for interpretation of the basic unit of pulmonary structure and function.},

There were approximately 5,000 ventilatory units at birth and on day 21, indicating that the lung grew by enlargement and subdivision of ventilatory units and not by their multiplication. Growth in hyperoxia (greater than 97{\%}) for 7 days had no effect on the number of ventilatory units but, compared to controls, total lung volume and ventilatory unit volume were reduced 32{\%} and 16{\%}, respectively. At birth there were 0.6 x 10(6) alveoli, and at age 7 days in controls alveolar number increased 16-fold while the average volume of a single alveolus fell to one-sixth that at birth. Exposure to hyperoxia for 7 days stopped alveolarization; the surface area to volume ratio (Sa/V) of the ventilatory unit was lower, alveolar number was the same as at birth, and the alveoli present were large. At age 21 days, after 14 days of recovery in air, lung volume and ventilatory unit volume were greater than in controls but the Sa/V of the ventilatory unit was still depressed 20{\%}. Alveoli from oxygen-exposed lungs were larger than in controls, and a greater size distribution coefficient showed them to be more variable. A shape coefficient for alveoli did not change as a function of the animal's age or oxygen treatment; it demonstrated proportional growth of alveolar height and diameter.},

abstract = {Genetically engineered mouse models of lung cancer are essential for preclinical evaluation of disease progression and treatments as well as in drug development. Micro-computed Tomography (microCT) is an imaging modality that is widely used in visualizing the anatomy of subjects in vivo and extracting quantitative and translatable biomarkers. This work demonstrates the use of uCT imaging and image segmentation techniques in large population phenotyping studies of transgenic mouse models of lung cancer. We studied 8 genotypes of transgenic mice with 99 subjects imaged at 4 time points. We developed (1) a high throughput image acquisition technique that acquires 60 subjects in 3 hours at an isotropic resolution of about 100 um, and (2) an automated segmentation algorithm to compute tumor and vasculature volume (TVV), a previously validated biomarker for lung cancer progression. TVV is computed as the difference between the whole lung and the functional lung (air space within lung) volumes. Previous work on automated lung segmentation focused on healthy lung or on segmentation of pulmonary nodules. We automatically compute TVV by determining a lung region of interest (ROI) by using the rib cage, the functional lung volume by thresholding within the lung ROI, and the whole lung volume by iteratively performing morphological hole-fill, bridge, and image close operations on the functional lung. We compare the automated results with that of manual analysis. Automated functional lung volume results were highly correlated to manual results (R2≥0.95) at all the time points. Whole lung volume was well-correlated to manual measurements (R2≥0.8 up to the 2nd time point), but required some manual correction at later time points when the tumors almost filled the lung. Overall this approach provided about 66{\%} time saving compared to manual analysis. Our innovative workflow with high throughput acquisition and automated segmentation enabled efficient phenotyping studies to aid drug development. {\textcopyright} (2013) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

abstract = {We studied both central conducting airway response and changes in the distribution of regional ventilation induced by inhaled histamine in healthy anesthetized and mechanically ventilated rabbit using a novel xenon-enhanced synchrotron radiation computed tomography (CT) imaging technique, K-edge subtraction imaging (KES). Images of specific ventilation were obtained using serial KES during xenon washin, in three axial lung slices, at baseline and twice after inhalation of histamine aerosol (50 or 125 mg/ml) in two groups of animals (n = 6 each). Histamine inhalation caused large clustered areas of poor ventilation, characterized by a drop in average specific ventilation (sV(m)), but an increase in sV(m) in the remaining lung zones indicating ventilation redistribution. Ventilation heterogeneity, estimated as coefficient of variation (CV) of sV(m) significantly increased following histamine inhalation. The area of ventilation defects and CV were significantly larger with the higher histamine dose. In conducting airways, histamine inhalation caused a heterogeneous airway response combining narrowing and dilatation in individual airways of different generations, with the probability for constriction increasing peripherally. This finding provides further in vivo evidence that airway reactivity in response to inhaled histamine is complex and that airway response may vary substantially with location within the bronchial tree.},

abstract = {Our current understanding of the transport and deposition of aerosols (viruses, bacteria, air pollutants, aerosolized drugs) deep in the lung has been grounded in dispersive theories based on untested assumptions about the nature of acinar airflow fields. Traditionally, these have been taken to be simple and kinematically reversible. In this article, we apply the recently discovered fluid mechanical phenomenon of irreversible low-Reynolds number flow to the lung. We demonstrate, through flow visualization studies in rhythmically ventilated rat lungs, that such a foundation is false, and that chaotic mixing may be key to aerosol transport. We found substantial alveolar flow irreversibility with stretched and folded fractal patterns, which lead to a sudden increase in mixing. These findings support our theory that chaotic alveolar flow-characterized by stagnation saddle points associated with alveolar vortices-governs gas kinematics in the lung periphery, and hence the transport, mixing, and ultimately the deposition of fine aerosols. This mechanism calls for a rethinking of the relationship of exposure and deposition of fine inhaled particles},

abstract = {Abstract The current state-of-the-art in image-based modeling allows derivation of patient-specific models of the lung, lobes, airways, and pulmonary vascular trees. The application of traditional engineering analyses of fluid and structural mechanics to image-based subject-specific models has the potential to provide new insight into structure–function relationships in the individual via functional interpretation that complements imaging and experimental studies. Three major issues that are encountered in studies of airflow through the bronchial airways are the representation of airway geometry, the imposition of physiological boundary conditions, and the treatment of turbulence. Here we review some efforts to resolve each of these issues, with particular focus on image-based models that have been developed to simulate airflow from the mouth to the terminal bronchiole, and subjected to physiologically meaningful boundary conditions via image registration and soft-tissue mechanics models.

abstract = {This study presents an automatic method for 3D reconstruction of vascular trees using computed-tomography angiographic (CTA) images. The program starts with the CTA slices, performs a sequential procedure of 3D image formation, preprocessing, segmentation, thinning, skeleton pruning and tree construction. It ends with vascular trees along with quantitative data about the trees such as values of diameter, length and bifurcation angles. All the involved algorithms are presented with the emphasis given to the skeleton pruning and tree construction algorithms. The skeletons obtained using a 3D thinning algorithm may contain cycles, spurs, isolated sticks, and non-unit-width parts, which hinder tree construction. As a solution to this problem, a skeleton pruning and tree construction algorithm is proposed. At each stage of the automatic procedure, 3D rendering is provided for visual inspection of the computed results. In the final output, the constructed vascular trees are visualized by rendering the 3D trees and the 3D binary image together in a transparent display mode. The program is carried out in a fully automatic fashion, with a few default settings. Occasionally, user intervention is needed at the 3D segmentation stage to impose an appropriate threshold when the automatic 3D segmentation is obviously sub-optimal for vessel delineation. Experimental demonstrations on both coronary artery phantom and a cast of coronary artery tree of a swine animal model are provided.},

abstract = {As a part of the European Union BIOMED I study "Assessment of Bone Quality in Osteoporosis," the trabecular structure of transiliac bone biopsies was assessed by conventional histomorphometry and by three-dimensional microcomputed tomography (microCT). Sixty-three cylindrical human transiliac bone specimens were obtained post mortem from 27 women and 36 men (age 23-92 years) and evaluated morphometrically in this study. For the conventional histomorphometric analysis, a pair of four undecalcified sections were prepared from two regions in the mediolateral plane of the bone cores. The sections were stained with the von Kossa technique to obtain high-contrast two-dimensional images. Prior to the histologic sectioning the samples were measured with a desktop microCT, providing a 14 microm nominal resolution. The morphometric parameters computed by both methods in two or three dimensions, respectively, were bone volume density (BV/TV), bone surface density (BS/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp). Results showed highly significant (p {\textless} 0.0001) correlations between conventional histology and microCT for BV/TV (r = 0.93), BS/TV (r = 0.91), Tb.Th (r = 0.84), and Tb.Sp (r = 0.91). The mean percentage differences between histology and microCT ranged from 2.5{\%} (BV/TV) to 6.1{\%} (Tb.Th). The high correlations and the low differences in terms of absolute numbers between conventional histomorphometric and microtomographic analysis are very promising for the use of micro-tomographic imaging. MicroCT is a nondestructive, fast, and very precise procedure that allows the measurement of cancellous and compact bone in unprocessed biopsies or small bones, as well as a fully automatic determination of three-dimensional morphometric indices.},

Individual proximal airway constriction was assessed by measuring the luminal cross-sectional area. Distal airway obstruction was estimated by measuring the ventilated alveolar area after inhaled xenon administration. Respiratory system conductance was assessed continuously. Proximal airway cross-sectional area decreased by 57{\%} of the baseline value by 20 min and recovered gradually but incompletely within 60 min. The ventilated alveolar area decreased immediately after histamine inhalation by 55{\%} of baseline value and recovered rapidly thereafter. The results indicate that the airway reaction to inhaled histamine and the subsequent recovery are significantly slower in proximal than in distal bronchi in healthy rabbit. The findings suggest that physiological reaction mechanisms to inhaled histamine in the airway walls of large and small bronchi are not similar.},

@article{Sauret2002,
abstract = {Clinical research on the deposition of inhaled substances (e.g. inhaled medications, airborne contaminants, fumes) in the lungs necessitates anatomical models of the airways. Current conducting airway models lack three-dimensional (3D) reality as little information is available in the literature on the distribution of the airways in space. This is a limitation to the assessment or predictions of the particle deposition in relation to the subject's anatomy. Detailed information on the full topology and morphology of the airways is thus required to model the airway tree realistically. This paper presents the length, diameter, gravity, coronal and sagittal angles that together describe completely the airways in 3D space. The angle at which the airways branch out from their parent (branching angle) and the rotation angle between successive bifurcation planes are also included. These data are from the study of two sets of airways computed tomography (CT) images. One CT scan was performed on a human tracheobronchial tree cast and the other on a healthy male volunteer. The airways in the first nine generations of the cast and in the first six conducting generations of the volunteer were measured using a computer-based algorithm. The data contribute to the knowledge of the lung anatomy. In particular, the spatial structure of the airways is shown to be strongly defined by the central airways with clear angular lobar patterns. Such patterns tend to disappear with a mean gravity, coronal and sagittal angles of 90 degrees in each generation higher than 13-15. The mean branching angle per generation appears independent of the lobe to which the airways belong. Non-planar geometry at bifurcation is observed with the mean (+/- SD) bifurcation plane rotation angle of 79 +/- 410 (n = 229). This angle appears constant over the generations studied. The data are useful for improving the 3D realism of the conducting airway structure modelling as well as for studying aerosol deposition, flow and biological significance of non-planar airway trees using analytical and computational flow dynamics modelling.},

abstract = {The deposition sites of inhaled aerosols in the gas-exchange region of the lung represent one of the key parameters needed for the understanding of the interaction between these particles and lung tissue. In order to develop a method for three-dimensional imaging of sub-micron particles in lung tissue we applied gold particles (200 and 700 nm) to rat lungs by intratracheal instillation. The samples were scanned at TOMCAT, the beamline for TOmographic Microscopy and Coherent rAdiology experimenTs at the Swiss Light Source. The 200 nm particles were slightly below the detection capabilities of TOMCAT. Therefore, their localization was obtained only by electron microscopy. At a voxel size of 350 nm we observed single and clustered gold particles (700 nm) in alveoli, alveolar ducts, and small bronchioli. The locations of the gold particles were verified by transmission electron microscopical serial sections. We observed a very high correlation between these two imaging modalities. We conclude that a combination of x-ray tomographic microscopy and electron microscopy allows the full unrestricted 3D localization of particles smaller than the resolution of x-ray tomographic microscopy. We are planning to use this method for the verification of the simulation of particle deposition in the airway tree.},

abstract = {Research into the pathogenesis underlying the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is hampered by a repertoire of animal models that fail to recapitulate all the features of the human disease. Better use and understanding of what the animal models represent may improve clinical predictability. We interrogated ex vivo micro-computed tomography (CT) as a novel end-point measure in the mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (BILF), and to evaluate a therapeutic dosing regimen for preclinical drug evaluation. A detailed characterisation of BILF was performed using standard end-point measures (lung hydroxyproline and histology). High resolution micro-CT (∼13.7 $\mu$m voxel size) was evaluated for quantifying the extent and severity of lung fibrosis. The period from 14 to 28 days following bleomycin instillation represents progression of established fibrosis. A therapeutic dosing regimen during this period was validated using a transforming growth factor-$\beta$ receptor-1 kinase inhibitor, and micro-CT provided a highly sensitive and quantitative measure of fibrosis. Moreover, fibrotic lesions did not completely resolve, but instead persisted for ≥6 months following a single insult with bleomycin. Ex vivo micro-CT analysis of BILF allows robust evaluation of therapeutic dosing once fibrosis is already well established, requiring fewer mice than conventional biochemical end-points.},

@article{Flecknell2002,
abstract = {In 1959, William Russell and Rex Burch published "The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique". They proposed that if animals were to be used in experiments, every effort should be made to Replace them with non-sentient alternatives, to Reduce to a minimum the number of animals used, and to Refine experiments which used animals so that they caused the minimum pain and distress. These guiding principles, the "3Rs" of animal research, were initially given little attention. Gradually, however, they have become established as essential considerations when animals are used in research. They have influenced new legislation aimed at controlling the use of experimental animals, and in the United Kingdom they have become formally incorporated into the Animal (Scientific) Procedures Act.The three principles, of Replacement, Reduction and Refinement, have also proven to be an area of common ground for research workers who use animals, and those who oppose their use. Scientists, who accept the need to use animals in some experiments, would also agree that it would be preferable not to use animals. If animals were to be used, as few as possible should be used and they should experience a minimum of pain or distress. Many of those who oppose animal experimentation, would also agree that until animal experimentation is stopped, Russell and Burch's 3Rs provide a means to improve animal welfare. It has also been recognised that adoption of the 3Rs can improve the quality of science. Appropriately designed experiments that minimise variation, provide standardised optimum conditions of animals care and minimise unnecessary stress or pain, often yield better more reliable data.Despite the progress made as a result of attention to these principles, several major problems have been identified. When replacing animals with alternative methods, it has often proven difficult to formally validate the alternative. This has proven a particular problem in regulatory toxicology, especially when combined with the labyrinthine processes of the various regulatory authorities.The principle of Reduction would appear less contentious, but its application has highlighted the difficulties of providing appropriate expert statistical advice, especially in academic research facilities. In some instances, concern to implement Reduction strategies can result in the use of too few animals, which leads to inconclusive results, and wasteful experiments.It is in the area of Refinement, however, that major problems have arisen. Much of our judgement of what represents Refinement is based on little more than common sense. We make assumptions about animals and their feelings that often have little scientific basis. In many instances we may be correct, but these assumptions may become incorporated into institutional or national policies, without any attempt to verify them. To give an example - it is reasonable to assume that animals will experience pain after a surgical procedure, so pain-relieving drugs should be given to prevent this. We have some idea of the appropriate dose of analgesics for most animals, but effective pain relief requires that dose given is adjusted to meet the requirements of the individual animal. Requiring every animal to have the same dose of the same drug after any surgical procedure is not the best way of dealing with post-operative pain.Discussion of these problems should not detract from the very significant progress that has been made in the 40 or so years since Russell and Burch set out their guiding principles. What is needed now is greater academic focus on this area, not only to work on new methods of implementing the 3Rs, but also to disseminate current "Best Practice, and to revise this advice as further progress is made.},

abstract = {The morphology and morphometric data of collagen and elastin fibers in the pulmonary alveolar walls are presented. Specimens were obtained from postmortem lungs quick-frozen at specified transpulmonary pressures. Collagen was stained by silver, and elastin was stained by orcein. Photomicrographs were composed by computer. Young lungs typically show small collagen fibers that radiate from the "posts," whereas larger fiber bundles traverse the septum irrespective of capillary blood vessels. In older lungs, rings of collagen around the posts appear enlarged. Elastin bundles do not show obvious variation in pattern with age and inflation pressure. Statistical frequency distributions of the fiber width and curvature are both skewed, but the square root of the width and the cube root of the curvature have approximate normal distributions. Typically, for young lungs at transpulmonary pressure of 4 cmH2O, the mean of (width)1/2 (in micron1/2) for collagen fibers is 0.952 +/- 0.242 (SD), that of (curvature)1/3 (in micron-1/3) is 0.349 +/- 0.094. The corresponding values for elastin are 0.986 +/- 0.255 and 0.395 +/- 0.094.},

abstract = {Rats are widely used for studies of pulmonary toxicology and lung disease. Several studies suggest nominal geometric parameters describing the architecture of the rat airway. However, intersubject variance has never been reported due to the huge effort and time to take these manual measurements. In this study, we present statistics of the branching pattern of six healthy male Sprague Dawley rats by automatically analyzing computed tomography images of silicon casts of their airways. Details of branching characteristics and also intersubject variance are presented. In addition, this study shows that mean and standard deviation of many geometric parameters insufficiently represent pulmonary architecture because some, such as diameter-asymmetry, are not normally distributed. Detailed statistics including inter- and intrasubject variance and distribution of the geometric parameters will aid in constructing more realistic airway models for particle transport and studies of normal and abnormal respiratory physiology.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional (3-D) model of the human pulmonary acinus, a gas exchange unit, is constructed with a labyrinthine algorithm generating branching ducts that fill a given space completely. Branching down to the third respiratory bronchioles is generated with the proposed algorithm. A subacinus, a region supplied by the last respiratory bronchiole, is approximated to be a set of cubic cells with a side dimension of 0.5 mm. The labyrinthine algorithm is used to determine a pathway through all cells only once, except at branching points with the smallest path lengths. In choosing each step of a pathway, random variables are used. Resulting labyrinths have equal mean path lengths and equal surface areas of inner walls. An alveolus can be generated by attaching alveolar septa, 0.25 mm long and 0.1 mm wide, to the inner walls. Total alveolar surface area and numbers of alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli in our 3-D acinar model are in good accordance with those reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The Ashcroft scale for the evaluation of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is the analysis of stained histological samples by visual assessment. Based on the knowledge that this procedure is not standardized in animals and results are highly variable, we hypothesized that modification of this method may improve quantification of lung fibrosis in small animals. To prove our hypothesis, we evaluated pulmonary fibrosis in Lewis rats induced by a single intratracheal injection of 0.3 mg/kg body weight bleomycin (n = 13) compared with the same amount of saline in a control group (n = 4). We modified the Ashcroft scale by precisely defining the assignment of grades from 0 to 8 for the increasing extent of fibrosis in lung histological samples. Thirty-two observers were randomly assigned to evaluate 108 photographs of slides using either the Ashcroft scale or the modified scale. Consistent with our hypothesis, there was a significant reduction in the variability of standard deviations with the modified scale compared with the Ashcroft scale (mean of variability 0.25 versus 0.62, P {\textless} 0.0001). Applying the kappa index, the Ashcroft scale showed only a fair to moderate agreement (0.23-0.59) between the observers and a low intra-observer agreement (0.51-0.74) in contrast to the modified scale, which demonstrated a moderate to good agreement between the observers (0.65-0.93, P {\textless} 0.0001) and a high intra-observer agreement (0.87-0.91, P {\textless} 0.05). To test the modified scale in vivo, we compared both scales with the results of computed tomography (CT) of the lungs obtained from the same mice. In agreement, the modified scale demonstrated a better correlation to CT scans (R = 0.58) compared with the Ashcroft scale (R = 0.33). In summary, quantification of lung fibrosis in histological lung sections using the modified scale is reliable and reproducible.},

abstract = {A significant improvement over conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging, which lacks contrast in small objects and soft biological tissues, is obtained by introducing phase-contrast imaging. As recently demonstrated, phase-contrast imaging is characterized by its extraordinary image quality, greatly enhanced contrast, and good soft tissue discrimination with very high spatial resolution down to the micron and even the sub-micron region. The rapid development of compact X-ray sources of high brightness, tuneability, and monochromaticity as well as high-resolution X-ray detectors with high quantum efficiency and improved computational methods is stimulating the development of a new generation of X-ray imaging systems for medical applications. The present paper reviews some intrinsic mechanisms, recent technical developments and potential medical applications of two-, three- and four-dimensional phase-contrast X-ray imaging. Challenging issues in current phase-contrast imaging techniques and key clinical applications are discussed and possible developments of future high-contrast and high spatial and temporal resolution medical X-ray imaging systems are outlined.},

A set of 50 digital radiography chest images was selected for use in the study, half containing a solitary pulmonary nodule and half nodule-free. The images were displayed twice to each of six observers, once on each display. Eye position was recorded on a subset of the images. Overall, there was a statistically significant difference (F = 4.1496, p = 0.0471) between the medical-grade color display and the COTS color display in terms of receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values, with the medical-grade display yielding higher diagnostic accuracy. Total viewing time did not differ significantly, but eye position data revealed differences, suggesting better search and decision-making efficiency with the medical-grade display. Medical-grade color displays at 1 year old yield better diagnostic and search efficiency than COTS color displays and thus are recommended for primary reading if color displays are to be used.},

abstract = {A method for computationally efficient skeletonization of three-dimensional tubular structures is reported. The method is specifically targeting skeletonization of vascular and airway tree structures in medical images but it is general and applicable to many other skeletonization tasks. The developed approach builds on the following novel concepts and properties: fast curve-thinning algorithm to increase computational speed, endpoint re-checking to avoid generation of spurious side branches, depth-and-length sensitive pruning, and exact tree-branch partitioning allowing branch volume and surface measurements. The method was validated in computer and physical phantoms and in vivo CT scans of human lungs. The validation studies demonstrated sub-voxel accuracy of branch point positioning, insensitivity to changes of object orientation, and high reproducibility of derived quantitative indices of the tubular structures offering a significant improvement over previously reported methods (p{\textless}0.001).},

abstract = {Medial axes and skeletons are notoriously sensitive to contour irregularities. This lack of stability is a serious problem for applications in e.g. shape analysis and recognition. In 2005, Chazal and Lieutier introduced the [lambda]-medial axis as a new concept for computing the medial axis of a shape subject to single parameter filtering. The [lambda]-medial axis is stable under small shape perturbations, as proved by these authors. In this article, a discrete [lambda]-medial axis (DLMA) is introduced and compared with the recently introduced integer medial axis (GIMA). We show that DLMA provides measurably better results than GIMA, with regard to stability and sensibility to rotations. We give efficient algorithms to compute the DLMA, and we also introduce a variant of the DLMA which may be computed in linear-time.},

@article{Nebuloni2014,
abstract = {The vasculature of body tissues is continuously subject to remodeling processes originating at the micro-vascular level. The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is essential for a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes such as tissue regeneration, tumor development and the integration of artificial tissues. There are currently no time-lapsed in vivo imaging techniques providing information on the vascular network at the capillary level in a non-destructive, three-dimensional and high-resolution fashion. This paper presents a novel imaging framework based on contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) for hierarchical in vivo quantification of blood vessels in mice, ranging from largest to smallest structures. The framework combines for the first time a standard morphometric approach with densitometric analysis. Validation tests showed that the method is precise and robust. Furthermore, the framework is sensitive in detecting different perfusion levels after the implementation of a murine ischemia-reperfusion model. Correlation with both histological data and micro-CT analysis of vascular corrosion casts confirmed accuracy of the method. The newly developed time-lapsed imaging approach shows high potential for in vivo monitoring of a number of different physiological and pathological conditions in angiogenesis and vascular development.},

@article{Massaro1992,
abstract = {We administered a glucocorticosteroid (dexamethasone) or its diluent
to pregnant rats on gestation days 17, 18, and 19. In male offspring
we determined the lung's gas exchange surface area (S(a)), the average
volume (v) of gas exchange saccules at age 2 days and alveoli at
age 14 days, and their number (N) on these days. S(a), v, and N at
2 days and v at 14 days were not affected by the prenatal administration
of dexamethasone. However, S(a) and N were lower in 14-day-old pups
from dexamethasone-treated dams than in pups from diluent-treated
dams. In separate experiments we found the responsiveness to prenatal
dexamethasone, as a depressor of the postnatal increase in S(a),
appeared earlier in female than male fetuses; it was present in female
but not in male fetuses on days 16-18 and was found in male fetuses
on days 17-19. We conclude 1) prenatal administration of dexamethasone
diminishes the postnatal increase in S(a), 2) responsiveness to this
action of dexamethasone occurs earlier in gestation in female than
in male fetuses, and 3) prenatal dexamethasone does not effect the
postnatal volume of an average alveolus but diminishes their number
in male pups.},

abstract = {According to the current view, the formation of new alveolar septa from preexisting ones ceases due to the reduction of a double- to a single-layered capillaries network inside the alveolar septa (microvasculature maturation postnatal days 14-21 in rats). We challenged this view by measuring stereologically the appearance of new alveolar septa and by studying the alveolar capillary network in three-dimensional (3-D) visualizations obtained by high-resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy. We observed that new septa are formed at least until young adulthood (rats, days 4-60) and that roughly half of the new septa are lifted off of mature septa containing single-layered capillary networks. At the basis of newly forming septa, we detected a local duplication of the capillary network. We conclude that new alveoli may be formed in principle at any time and at any location inside the lung parenchyma and that lung development continues into young adulthood. We define two phases during developmental alveolarization. Phase one (days 4-21), lifting off of new septa from immature preexisting septa, and phase two (day 14 through young adulthood), formation of septa from mature preexisting septa. Clinically, our results ask for precautions using drugs influencing structural lung development during both phases of alveolarization.},

abstract = {Bone microarchitecture is believed to play a key role in determining bone quality. We therefore present a new method for the volumetric spatial decomposition of trabecular bone samples into its basic elements (rods and plates). This new method is a framework for the element based description of bone microarchitecture. First, the newly developed algorithm was validated on computer-generated models. Then, it was applied to 328 human trabecular bone samples harvested from 70 donors at five different anatomical sites (calcaneus, femoral head, iliac crest, lumbar spine 2 and 4), which were previously scanned by microcomputed tomography. Standard three-dimensional morphometric algorithms were used to analyze the trabeculae on an individual basis with respect to their volume, surface, and thickness. The results were statistically compared for the five sites. In this study, it was possible for the first time to spatially decompose trabecular bone structures in its volumetric elements; rods and plates. The size of the largest element in the structures showed significant differences for the five compared sites. In samples from femoral head, we found that basically one "major element" was spanning through the whole structure whereas in lumbar spine and calcaneus, smaller elements dominate. From this, we suggest that the strength of strong, dense plate-like structures is determined by the major elements whereas in looser rod-like structures the strength is given by the arrangement, quality, and shape of a whole set of elements. Furthermore, we found that globally determined structural indices such as the mean curvature of the bone surface ({\textless}H{\textgreater}) or related to this the structure model index (SMI) are almost exclusively explained by the arrangement of the plates. This also suggests that rods hold independent information characterizing trabecular bone quality, especially in the spine. These findings may improve the understanding of the site-specific role of bone microarchitecture in determining bone quality and in future studies the competence of bone.},

abstract = {Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a treatment resistant disease with poor prognosis. Numerous compounds have been demonstrated to efficiently prevent pulmonary fibrosis (PF) in animal models but only a few were successful when given to animals with established fibrosis. Major concerns of current PF models are spontaneous resolution and high variability of fibrosis, and the lack of assessment methods that can allow to monitor the effect of drugs in individual animals over time. We used a model of experimental PF in rats and compare parameters obtained in living animals with conventional assessment tools that require removal of the lungs. PF was induced in rats by adenoviral gene transfer of transforming growth factor-beta. Morphological and functional changes were assessed for up to 56 days by micro-CT, lung compliance (measured via a mechanical ventilator) and VO2max and compared to histomorphometry and hydroxyproline content. Standard histological and collagen assessment confirmed the persistent fibrotic phenotype as described before. The histomorphological scores correlated both to radiological (r2 = 0.29, p {\textless} 0.01) and functional changes (r2 = 0.51, p {\textless} 0.0001). VO2max did not correlate with fibrosis. The progression of pulmonary fibrosis can be reliably assessed and followed in living animals over time using invasive, non-terminal compliance measurements and micro-CT. This approach directly translates to the management of patients with IPF and allows to monitor therapeutic effects in drug intervention studies.},

abstract = {The common experimental use of B16-F10 melanoma cells focuses on exploring their metastatic potential following intravenous injection into mice. In this study, B16-F10 cells are used to develop a primary tumor model by implanting them directly into the ears of C57BL/6J mice. The model represents a reproducible and easily traceable tool for local tumor growth and for making additional in vivo observations, due to the localization of the tumors. This model is relatively simple and involves (i) surgical opening of the ear skin, (ii) removal of a square-piece of cartilage followed by (iii) the implantation of tumor cells with fibrin gel. The remodeling of the fibrin gel within the cartilage chamber, accompanying tumor proliferation, results in the formation of blood vessels, lymphatics and tissue matrix that can be readily distinguished from the pre-existing skin structures. Moreover, this method avoids the injection-enforced artificial spread of cells into the pre-existing lymphatic vessels. The tumors have a highly reproducible exponential growth pattern with a tumor doubling time of around 1.8 days, reaching an average volume of 85mm3 16 days after implantation. The melanomas are densely cellular with proliferative indices of between 60 and 80{\%}. The induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis resulted in the development of well-vascularized tumors. Different populations of immunologically active cells were also present in the tumor; the population of macrophages decreases with time while the population of T cells remained quasi constant. The B16-F10 tumors in the ear frequently metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes, reaching an incidence of 75{\%} by day 16. This newly introduced B16-F10 melanoma model in the ear is a powerful tool that provides a new opportunity to study the local tumor growth and metastasis, the associated angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and tumor immune responses. It could potentially be used to test different treatment strategies.},

However, to obtain statistically relevant results, a large area of the brain (several square millimeters) must be analyzed. This leads us to consider huge images, too large to be loaded and processed at once in the memory of a standard computer. To consider a large area, a compact representation of the vessels is required. The medial axis is the preferred tool for this application. To extract it, a dedicated skeletonization algorithm is proposed. Numerous approaches already exist which focus on computational efficiency. However, they all implicitly assume that the image can be completely processed in the computer memory, which is not realistic with the large images considered here. We present in this paper a skeletonization algorithm that processes data locally (in subimages) while preserving global properties (i.e., homotopy). We then show some results obtained on a mosaic of three-dimensional images acquired by confocal microscopy.},

The potential for nanoparticles (NPs) in these areas is infinite, with novel new applications constantly being explored. The possible toxic health effects of these NPs associated with human exposure are unknown. Many fine particles generally considered ``nuisance dusts'' are likely to acquire unique surface properties when engineered to nanosize and may exhibit toxic biological effects. Consequently, the nuisance dust may be transported to distant sites and could induce adverse health effects. In addition the beneficial uses of NPs in drug delivery, cancer treatment, and gene therapy may cause unintentional human exposure. Because of our lack of knowledge about the health effects associated with NP exposure, we have an ethical duty to take precautionary measures regarding their use. In this review we highlight the possible toxic human health effects that can result from exposure to ultrafine particles (UFPs) generated by anthropogenic activities and their cardiopulmonary outcomes. The comparability of engineered NPs to UFPs suggests that the human health effects are likely to be similar. Therefore, it is prudent to elucidate their toxicologic effect to minimize occupational and environmental exposure. Highlighting the human health outcomes caused by UFPs is not intended to give a lesser importance to either the unprecedented technologic and industrial rewards of the nanotechnology or their beneficial human uses.},

abstract = {Spontaneous contractions of the fetal airways are a well recognized but poorly characterized phenomenon. In the present study spontaneous narrowing of the airways was analyzed in freshly isolated lungs from early to late gestation in fetal pigs and rabbits and in cultured fetal mouse lungs. Propagating waves of contraction traveling proximal to distal were observed in fresh lungs throughout gestation which displaced the lung liquid along the lumen. In the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages (fetal pigs) the frequency ranged from 2.3 to 3.3 contractions/min with a 39 to 46{\%} maximum reduction of lumen diameter. In the saccular stage (rabbit) the frequency was 10 to 12/min with a narrowing of approximately 30{\%}. In the organ cultures the waves of narrowing started at the trachea in whole lungs, or at the main bronchus in lobes (5.2 +/- 1.5 contractions/min, 22 +/- 8{\%} reduction of lumen diameter), and as they proceeded distally along the epithelial tubes the luminal liquid was shifted toward the terminal tubules, which expanded the endbuds. As the tubules relaxed the flow of liquid was reversed. Thus the behavior of airway smooth muscle in the fetal lung is phasic in type (like gastrointestinal muscle) in contrast to that in postnatal lung, where it is tonic. An intraluminal positive pressure of 2.33 +/- 0.77 cm H(2)O was recorded in rabbit fetal trachea. It is proposed that the active tone of the smooth muscle maintains the positive intraluminal pressure and acts as a stimulus to lung growth via the force exerted across the airway wall and adjacent parenchyma. The expansion of the compliant endbuds by the fluid shifts at the airway tip may promote their growth into the surrounding mesenchyme.},

abstract = {The small trees of gas-exchanging pulmonary airways, which are fed by the most distal purely conducting airways, are called acini and represent the functional gas-exchanging units. The three-dimensional architecture of the acini has a strong influence on ventilation and particle deposition. Due to the difficulty in identifying individual acini on microscopic lung sections, the knowledge about the number of acini and their biological parameters, like volume, surface area, and number of alveoli per acinus, are limited. We developed a method to extract individual acini from lungs imaged by high-resolution synchrotron radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy and estimated their volume, surface area, and number of alveoli. Rat acini were isolated by semiautomatically closing the airways at the transition from conducting to gas-exchanging airways. We estimated a mean internal acinar volume of 1.148 mm(3), a mean acinar surface area of 73.9 mm(2), and a mean of 8,470 alveoli/acinus. Assuming that the acini are similarly sized throughout different regions of the lung, we calculated that a rat lung contains 5,470 ± 833 acini. We conclude that our novel approach is well suited for the fast and reliable characterization of a large number of individual acini in healthy, diseased, or transgenic lungs of different species, including humans.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The superior radiation dose efficiency of a newly implemented differential phase contrast CT imaging method compared to the conventional absorption CT method is demonstrated. METHODS: A differential phase contrast CT imaging method has recently been implemented using conventional x-ray sources with a grating interferometer consisting of three gratings. This approach offers the possibility of simultaneous reconstruction of both attenuation contrast and phase contrast images from a single acquisition. This enables a direct comparison of radiation dose efficiency of both types of reconstructed images under identical conditions. Radiation dose efficiency was studied by measuring the change in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) with different exposure levels. A physical phantom of 28.5 mm diameter was constructed and used for measurement of CNR in both the absorption and phase contrast CT images, which were reconstructed from the same data set. RESULTS: For three of the four materials studied, at any given exposure level, the CNR of the differential phase contrast CT images was superior to that of the corresponding absorption contrast CT images. The most dramatic improvement was noted in the contrast between PMMA and water, where the CNR was improved by a factor of approximately 5.5 in the differential phase contrast CT images. Additionally, the CNR of phase contrast CT is empirically shown to have the same square root dependence on exposure, as is the case for absorption contrast CT. CONCLUSIONS: The differential phase contrast CT method provided higher CNR than conventional absorption CT at equivalent dose levels for most of the materials studied, and so may enable achievement of the same object visibility as conventional absorption CT methods at a lower exposure level.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to use high resolution (HR) magnetic resonance (MR) images of the calcaneus to investigate the trabecular structure of patients with and without osteoporotic hip fractures and to compare these techniques with bone mineral density (BMD) in differentiating fracture and nonfracture patients. Axial and sagittal HR MR images of the calcaneus were obtained in 50 female (23 postmenopausal patients with osteoporotic hip fractures and 27 postmenopausal controls). A three-dimensional gradient-echo sequence was used with a slice thickness of 500 micron and in plane resolution of 195 x 195 micron. Texture analysis was performed using morphological features, analogous to standard histomorphometry and fractal dimension. Additionally, BMd measurements of the hip (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) were obtained in all patients. Significant differences between both patient groups were obtained using morphological parameters and fractal dimension as well as hip BMD (p {\textless} 0.05). Odds ratios for the texture parameters apparent (app.) bone volume/total volume and app. trabecular separation were higher than for hip BMD. Receiver operator characteristic values of texture measures and hip BMD were comparable. In conclusion, trabecular structure measures derived from HR MR images of the calcaneus can differentiate between postmenopausal women with and without osteoporotic hip fractures.},

abstract = {In this study, the upper-limit volume (gas plus partial tissue volume) as well as absolute volume (gas only) of lungs measured with hyperpolarized (3)He-MR imaging is compared with that determined by micro-computed tomography (CT) under similar ventilation conditions in normal rats. Five Brown Norway rats (210-259 g) were ventilated with O(2), alternately with (3)He, using a computer-controlled ventilator, and 3D density-weighted images of the lungs were acquired during a breath hold after six wash-in breaths of (3)He. The rats were then transferred to a micro-CT scanner, and a similar experimental setup was used to obtain images of the lungs during a breath hold of air with an airway pressure equal to that of the MR imaging breath hold. The upper-limit and absolute volumes obtained from (3)He-MR and micro-CT methods were not significantly different (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The good agreement between the lung volumes measured with the two imaging methods suggests that (3)He-MR imaging can be used for quantitative analysis of lung volume changes in longitudinal studies without the exposure to the ionizing radiation which accompanies micro-CT imaging.},

Here we show that multimodal multiphoton microscopy provides novel insights into lung fibrosis. We characterize normal and fibrotic pulmonary tissue in the bleomycin model, and show that second-harmonic generation by fibrillar collagen reveals the micrometer-scale three-dimensional spatial distribution of the fibrosis. We find that combined two-photon excited fluorescence and second-harmonic imaging of unstained lung tissue allows separating the inflammatory and fibrotic steps in this pathology, underlining characteristic features of fibroblastic foci in human Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis samples. Finally, we propose phenomenological scores of lung fibrosis and we show that they unambiguously sort out control and treated mice, with a better sensitivity and reproducibility in the subpleural region. These results should be readily generalized to other organs, as an accurate method to assess extracellular matrix remodeling during fibrosis.},

A semi-automated algorithm has been developed to obtain the full 3D topology and dimensions (direction cosine, length, diameter, branching and gravity angles) of branching networks using their CT images. It has been tested using CT images of a simple Perspex branching network and applied to the CT images of a human cast of the airway tree. The morphology and topology of the computer derived network were compared with the manually measured dimensions. Good agreement was found. The airways dimensions also compared well with previous values quoted in literature. This algorithm can provide complete data set analysis much more quickly than manual measurements. Its use is limited by the CT resolution which means that very small branches are not visible. New data are presented on the branching angles of the airway tree.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION Three-dimensional collagen matrices (3D-CMs) may be visualized by cumbersome reconstructions of serial sections. We report here on the method of synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to image 3D-CMs in native tissue probes. MATERIAL AND METHODS SRXTM of 3D-CMs (mucoderm{\textregistered}, mucograft{\textregistered}) was performed at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute (Villigen, Switzerland). RESULTS SRXTM combines the advantages of high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging with the low-resolution reconstructions of micro-CT ($\mu$CT) imaging. It may be used to non-destructively visualize and analyze structures within the 3D-CMs without the need of serial sectioning and reconstruction. CONCLUSION High-resolution SRXTM is a useful tool in analyzing the topology and morphometry of structures in 3D-CMs. The outcome justifies the efforts in sophisticated data processing. CLINICAL RELEVANCE SRXTM may help to understand the clinical characteristics of 3D-CMs in more detail.},

abstract = {CMOS vision sensors, as all electronic systems, are very sensitive to temperature variation. Mainly, this sensitivity limits their DC electrical behaviour. So far, no elegant integrated solution of this shortcoming has been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a compensation technique within the circuit in order to decrease power consumption and response time. To overcome this defect caused by temperature, we propose a temperature compensation method based on drain current IDS characteristics with temperature. Among these characteristics we have a Zero Temperature Coefficient (ZTC) which will be used to compensate temperature variation. With this method, we reduce 98{\%} of the influence of temperature on the output value of a standard CMOS image sensor, and obtain good temperature stability (1 mV) in the temperature ranges from -30°C to 125°C. The proposed temperature compensation method is described in details in this paper. Finally, we present simulations results, along with advantages and disadvantages of our compensation method.},

The rapid freezing/freeze-substitution preparation is applicable to whole cells and tissues, and it is the method of choice for ET investigations of cellular ultrastructure. The frozen-hydrated preparation provides the best possible structural preservation and allows the imaging of molecules, complexes, and supramolecular assemblies in their native state and their natural environment. Devoid of staining and chemical fixation artifacts, cryo-ET provides a faithful representation of both the surface and internal structure of molecules. In combination with advanced computational methods, such as molecular identification based on pattern recognition techniques, cryo-ET is currently the most promising approach to comprehensively map macromolecular architecture inside cellular tomograms.},

abstract = {The inhalation of micron-sized aerosols into the lung's acinar region may be recognized as a possible health risk or a therapeutic tool. In an effort to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for acinar deposition, we have numerically simulated the transport of nondiffusing fine inhaled particles (1 mum and 3 microm in diameter) in two acinar models of varying complexity: (i) a simple alveolated duct and (ii) a space-filling asymmetrical acinar branching tree following the description of lung structure by Fung (1988, "A Model of the Lung Structure and Its Validation," J. Appl. Physiol., 64, pp. 2132-2141). Detailed particle trajectories and deposition efficiencies, as well as acinar flow structures, were investigated under different orientations of gravity, for tidal breathing motion in an average human adult. Trajectories and deposition efficiencies inside the alveolated duct are strongly related to gravity orientation. While the motion of larger particles (3 microm) is relatively insensitive to convective flows compared with the role of gravitational sedimentation, finer 1 microm aerosols may exhibit, in contrast, complex kinematics influenced by the coupling between (i) flow reversal due to oscillatory breathing, (ii) local alveolar flow structure, and (iii) streamline crossing due to gravity. These combined mechanisms may lead to twisting and undulating trajectories in the alveolus over multiple breathing cycles. The extension of our study to a space-filling acinar tree was well suited to investigate the influence of bulk kinematic interaction on aerosol transport between ductal and alveolar flows. We found the existence of intricate trajectories of fine 1 microm aerosols spanning over the entire acinar airway network, which cannot be captured by simple alveolar models. In contrast, heavier 3 microm aerosols yield trajectories characteristic of gravitational sedimentation, analogous to those observed in the simple alveolated duct. For both particle sizes, however, particle inhalation yields highly nonuniform deposition. While larger particles deposit within a single inhalation phase, finer 1 microm particles exhibit much longer residence times spanning multiple breathing cycles. With the ongoing development of more realistic models of the pulmonary acinus, we aim to capture some of the complex mechanisms leading to deposition of inhaled aerosols. Such models may lead to a better understanding toward the optimization of pulmonary drug delivery to target specific regions of the lung.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional imaging of the intact lung and its vasculature is essential if the hierarchical and volumetric aspects of its structures and functions are to be quantitated. Although this is possible with clinical multislice helical CT scanners, the spatial resolution does not scale down adequately for small rodents for which cubic voxel dimensions of 50-100 microm are required. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) provides the necessary spatial resolution of 3D images of the intact thoracic contents. Micro-CT can provide higher resolution so that basic micro-architectural structures, such as alveoli, can be individually visualized and quantitated. Dynamic events, such as the respiratory and cardiac cycles, can be imaged at multiple time points throughout a representative cycle by coordinating the scan sequence (i.e., gating) to the cycle phase of a sequence of cycles. Fusion of the micro-CT image data with other image data, such as micro-SPECT or histology, can enhance the information content beyond the mainly structural information provided by micro-CT. Conventional attenuation-based X-ray imaging can involve significant X-ray exposures at high spatial resolutions, and this could affect the phenotype (e.g., via interstitial fibrosis) and genotype (e.g., via mutation), so its use in longitudinal studies using micro-CT may be limited in some cases. However, because of recent developments in which the phase shift or refraction of X-rays rather than attenuation is used, the X-ray exposure may be significantly reduced.},

Here we present results of an experiment performed on a cylindrical sample of epoxy-impregnated hardened cement paste of about 30$\mu$m in diameter. Two-dimensional cross sections of the three-dimensional electron density map show a microstructure that bears distinct similarity to that observed by back-scattered scanning electron microscopy. Domains of various residues of cement grains, calcium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, epoxy-resin impregnated calcium silicate hydrates, epoxy-resin impregnated porosity, and unimpregnated porosity are revealed and are manifested as distinguishable peaks in the histogram of the three-dimensional electron density map. On assumptions of (i) a priori knowledge of the chemical composition and (ii) the purity of the analysed regions, the mass densities of the above mentioned individual material phases are estimated. The potential of PXCT for the science of cement and concrete is discussed.},

Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of "voxels" in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like "0.5") may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are-as we show here-simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the sigma-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas sigma-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

abstract = {The influence of different physical parameters, such as the source size and the energy spectrum, on the functional capability of a grating interferometer applied for phase-contrast imaging is discussed using numerical simulations based on Fresnel diffraction theory. The presented simulation results explain why the interferometer could be well combined with polychromatic laboratory x-ray sources in recent experiments. Furthermore, it is shown that the distance between the two gratings of the interferometer is not in general limited by the width of the photon energy spectrum. This implies that interferometers that give a further improved image quality for phase measurements can be designed, because the primary measurement signal for phase measurements can be increased by enlargement of this distance. Finally, the mathematical background and practical instructions for the quantitative evaluation of measurement data acquired with a polychromatic x-ray source are given.},

High signal-to-noise ratio, quantitative information on very complex structures like the brain micro vessel architecture, lung airways or fuel cells can be obtained thanks to the combination of dedicated sample preparation protocols, in-situ acquisition schemes and cutting-edge imaging analysis instruments. In this work we report on recent experiments carried out at the TOMCAT beamline of the Swiss Light Source [1] where synchrotron-based tomographic microscopy has been successfully used to obtain fundamental information on preliminary models for cerebral fluid flow [2] , to provide an accurate mesh for 3D finite-element simulation of the alveolar structure of the pulmonary acinus [3] and to investigate the complex functional mechanism of fuel cells [4] . Further, we introduce preliminary results on the combination of absorption and phase contrast microscopy for the visualization of high-Z nanoparticles in soft tissues, a fundamental information when designing modern drug delivery systems [5]. As an outlook we briefly discuss the new possibilities offered by high sensitivity, high resolution grating interferomtery as well as Zernike Phase contrast nanotomography [6] . {\textcopyright} 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Since we started to publish our first results (Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}inz-Cantero, 2010) with preliminary results using microtomography, we experienced significant improvements of the results, accordingly to implementations of techniques and in parallel with our scanning and software reconstruction skills, in parallel to new developments of the Bruker-Skyscan software. This is very apparent when comparing the images obtained in successive years (Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}inz-Cantero, 2010; Alba-Tercedor {\&} S{\'{a}}nchez-Tocino, 2011; Alba-Tercedor, 2012; Alba-Tercedor et al., 2012; Verd{\'{u}} et al., 2012; Alba-Tercedor, 2013; Alba-Tercedor et al., 2013b,2013c), and videos as well (see links [13]). Because we have been receiving many requests asking us to explain how to proceed to achieve these results, we decided to summarize the steps we more often follow, from the sample preparation until the visualization of the volume renderings. However, this paper cannot be considered neither pretends to be, a substitute of the “methods notes” and manuals of the software that Bruker-Skyscan produces, but a complementary guides aiming to help users to avoid the frustrations and waste of time that many times we have experienced.},

Currently, there is more human data than small animal data on airway morphometry. In this study, we implemented a semi-automatic approach to quantitatively describe airway tree geometry by using high-resolution computed tomography (CT) images to build a tree data structure for small animals such as rats and mice. Silicon lung casts of the excised lungs from a canine and a mouse were used for micro-CT imaging of the airway trees. The programming language IDL was used to implement a 3D region-growing threshold algorithm for segmenting out the airway lung volume from the CT data. Subsequently, a fully-parallel 3D thinning algorithm was implemented in order to complete the skeletonization of the segmented airways. A tree data structure was then created and saved by parsing through the skeletonized volume using the Python programming language. Pertinent information such as the length of all airway segments was stored in the data structure. This approach was shown to be accurate and efficient for up to six generations for the canine lung cast and ten generations for the mouse lung cast.},

In this study, we characterized the morphology of individual acini and a cluster of acini stemming from the same terminal conducting airway using a quantitative approach based on the semi-automatic segmentation of synchrotron micro-CT images of mouse lung. The volume and surface area of five clusters of mouse acini including 50 individual acini were estimated based on the voxel and surface mesh of segmented acini at FRC. The pathway length and width were estimated for one cluster including 15 acini based on the skeleton of segmented acini. The acinar volume was 0.09 6 0.07 mm 3 (mean 6 SD), and the surface area was 6.82 6 4.49 mm 2 , in agreement with previous studies. The volume of the acinar clusters was 0.89 6 0.34 mm 3 , and the surface area was 68.18 6 17.66 mm 2 . The largest volume acinus per cluster was found in the distal region of the terminal conducting airway, and apparent respiratory bron-chioles were observed only in large-volume acini. The generation number of pathways per acinus was 8 6 2 (range: 6–12). The pathway length at lower generations (generations 2–6) increased with the generation num-ber in a single cluster, while did not significantly change at lower genera-tions in some acinar groups. The pathway width increased with increasing generation numbers. Our approach characterized the quantita-tive morphology of pulmonary acinar clusters in mouse lung, and the results can be used in further biomechanical simulation studies. Anat Rec, 299:1424–1434,},

abstract = {The 8th edition of the tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) classification provides several new categories and for the first time, some prospective data are included. The T (tumor) descriptor is further subdivided with 1 cm increments for T1 and T2 disease. For metastatic disease (M descriptor) the new M1b category comprises patients with only one metastasis in one distant organ, whereas M1c implies multiple distant metastases in one or several organs. There are no changes regarding the nodal map and N component but new categories are suggested for further analysis, subdividing the N1 and N2 descriptors into involvement of single or multiple lymph node stations. The residual tumor (R) classification, related to completeness of resection, was revised in the 7th edition specifically for lung cancer resection and has been maintained in its revised form in the 8th edition. For the first time, a thorough analysis has been made of patients with multiple lung lesions distinguishing four distinct categories. Although prospective data were used for this edition, their overall number is low and more good-quality prospective data collection coming from all continents is certainly required. Main challenge for subsequent editions is the combination of specific anatomical factors with detailed immunohistochemical data and information from biomarkers and mutational changes inside the primary tumor as well as those occurring in lymph node and distant metastases. In this way not only prognosis of our patients with lung cancer will be better determined, but more specific diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms may be applied.},

abstract = {This study was performed to observe microstructures of the rat lung, using a synchrotron radiation beam and to compare findings with histological observations. X-ray refraction images from ex-vivo ventilating rat lung were obtained with an 8 KeV monochromatic beam and 20-mum thick CsI(Tl) scintillation crystal. The visual image was magnified using a 20x microscope objective and captured using an analog CCD camera. Obtained images were compared with conventional light microscopic findings from the same tissue. Pulmonary microstructures, including alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, alveoli, alveolar walls, and perialveolar capillary networks were clearly identified with spatial resolution of as much as 1.2 mum and had good correlation with conventional light microscopic findings. The shape of alveoli appeared more round in SR images than in the light microscopic images. The results suggest that X-ray microscopy study of the lung using synchrotron radiation demonstrates the potential for clinically relevant microstructure of lung tissue without sectioning and fixation.},

abstract = {Previous morphometric methods for estimation of the volume of components, surface area and thickness of the diffusion barrier in fish gills have taken advantage of the highly ordered structure of these organs for sampling and surface area estimations, whereas the thickness of the diffusion barrier has been measured orthogonally on perpendicularly sectioned material at subjectively selected sites. Although intuitively logical, these procedures do not have a demonstrated mathematical basis, do not involve random sampling and measurement techniques, and are not applicable to the gills of all fish. The present stereological methods apply the principles of surface area estimation in vertical uniform random sections to the gills of the Brazilian teleost Arapaima gigas. The tissue was taken from the entire gill apparatus of the right-hand or left-hand side (selected at random) of the fish by systematic random sampling and embedded in glycol methacrylate for light microscopy. Arches from the other side were embedded in Epoxy resin. Reference volume was estimated by the Cavalieri method in the same vertical sections that were used for surface density and volume density measurements. The harmonic mean barrier thickness of the water-blood diffusion barrier was calculated from measurements taken along randomly selected orientation lines that were sine-weighted relative to the vertical axis. The values thus obtained for the anatomical diffusion factor (surface area divided by barrier thickness) compare favourably with those obtained for other sluggish fish using existing methods},

abstract = {High resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT), or microCT, is a promising and already widely used technique in various scientific fields. Also for histological purposes it has great potential. Although microCT has proven to be a valuable technique for the imaging of bone structures, the visualization of soft tissue structures is still an important challenge due to their low inherent X-ray contrast. One way to achieve contrast enhancement is to make use of contrast agents. However, contrary to light and electron microscopy, knowledge about contrast agents and staining procedures is limited for X-ray CT. The purpose of this paper is to identify useful X-ray contrast agents for soft tissue visualization, which can be applied in a simple way and are also suited for samples larger than (1 cm)(3) . And 28 chemical substances have been investigated. All chemicals were applied in the form of concentrated aqueous solutions in which the samples were immersed. First, strips of green Bacon were stained to evaluate contrast enhancement between muscle and adipose tissue. Furthermore it was also tested whether the contrast agents remained fixed in the tissue after staining by re-immersing them in water. Based on the results, 12 contrast agents were selected for further testing on postmortem mice hind legs, containing a variety of different tissues, including muscle, fat, bone, cartilage and tendons. It was evaluated whether the contrast agents allowed a clearer distinction between the different soft tissue structures present. Finally also penetration depth was measured. And 26 chemicals resulted in contrast enhancement between muscle and adipose tissue in the Bacon strips. Mercury(II)chloride (HgCl2 ), phosphotungstic acid (PTA), phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) and ammonium orthomolybdate ((NH4 )2 MoO4 ) remained fixed after re-immersion in water. The penetration tests showed that potassium iodide (KI) and sodium tungstate can be most efficiently used for large samples of the order of several tens of cm(3) . PMA, PTA, HgCl2 and also to a lesser extent Na2 WO4 and (NH4 )2 MoO4 allowed a clearer distinction between the different soft tissue structures present.},

abstract = {A registration-based multiscale method to obtain a deforming geometric model of mouse acinus is presented. An intact mouse lung was fixed by means of vascular perfusion at a hydrostatic inflation pressure of 20 cmH(2)O. Microcomputed tomography ($\mu$CT) scans were obtained at multiple resolutions. Substructural morphometric analysis of a complete acinus was performed by computing a surface-to-volume (S/V) ratio directly from the 3D reconstruction of the acinar geometry. A geometric similarity is observed to exist in the acinus where S/V is approximately preserved anywhere in the model. Using multiscale registration, the shape of the acinus at an elevated inflation pressure of 25 cmH(2)O is estimated. Changes in the alveolar geometry suggest that the deformation within the acinus is not isotropic. In particular, the expansion of the acinus (from 20 to 25 cmH(2)O) is accompanied by an increase in both surface area and volume in such a way that the S/V ratio is not significantly altered. The developed method forms a useful tool in registration-driven fluid and solid mechanics studies as displacement of the alveolar wall becomes available in a discrete sense.},

@article{Schittny1997,
abstract = {At birth, the mammalian lung is still immature. The alveoli are not yet formed and the interairspace walls contain two capillary layers which are separated by an interstitial core. After alveolarization (first 2 postnatal weeks in rats) the alveolar septa mature: their capillary layers merge, the amount of connective tissue decreases, and the mature lung parenchyma is formed (second and third week). During the first 3 wk of life the role of tissue transglutaminase (tTG) was studied in rat lung by immunostaining of cryostat and paraffin sections, by Northern and Western blotting, and by a quantitative determination of gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine. While enzyme activity and intracellular tTG were already present before term, the enzyme product (gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine-crosslink) and extracellular tTG appeared between postnatal days 10 and 19 in the lung parenchyma. In large blood vessels and large airways, which mature earlier than the parenchyma, both the enzyme product and extracellular tTG had already appeared at the end of the first postnatal week. We conclude that tTG is expressed and externalized into the extracellular matrix of lung shortly before maturation of an organ area. Because tTG covalently and irreversibly crosslinks extracellular matrix proteins, we hypothesize that it may prevent or delay further remodeling of basement membranes and may stabilize other extracellular components, such as microfibrils.},

This study examined small airway pathology using a novel combination of multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT), micro-computed tomography (microCT) and histology.Airway branches visible on specimen MDCT were counted and the dimensions of the third- to fifth-generation airways were computed, while the terminal bronchioles (designated TB), preterminal bronchioles (TB-1) and pre-preterminal bronchioles (TB-2) were examined with microCT and histology in eight explanted lungs with end-stage COPD and seven unused donor lungs that served as controls.On MDCT, COPD lungs showed a decrease in the number of 2-2.5 mm diameter airways and the lumen area of fifth-generation airways, while on microCT there was a reduction in the number of terminal bronchioles as well as a decrease in the luminal areas, wall volumes and alveolar attachments to the walls of TB, TB-1 and TB-2 bronchioles. The combination of microCT and histology showed increased B-cell infiltration into the walls of TB-1 and TB-2 bronchioles, and this change was correlated with a reduced number of alveolar attachments in COPD.Small airways disease extends from 2 mm diameter airways to the terminal bronchioles in COPD. Destruction of alveolar attachments may be driven by a B-cell-mediated immune response in the preterminal bronchioles.},

The morphometric parameters defining these partial resistances, which can be determined on electron micrographs of lung sections by means of stereological methods, include the gas exchange surfaces, the capillary blood volume and hematocrit, and the harmonic mean thickness of the various layers. The merits and limitations of different methods of tissue preparation under “supravital” conditions are discussed and the basic stereological procedures necessary for deriving the parameters are outlined. The introduction of appropriate physical coefficients permits calculation of morphometric values of pulmonary (Dl) and membrane (Dm) diffusion capacities which can be used in attempts of quantitative structure-function correlation.},

Despite the existence of these powerful segmentation methods, the needs of clinical research continue to be fulfilled, to a large extent, using slice-by-slice manual tracing. To bridge the gap between methodological advances and clinical routine, we developed an open source application called ITK-SNAP, which is intended to make level set segmentation easily accessible to a wide range of users, including those with little or no mathematical expertise. This paper describes the methods and software engineering philosophy behind this new tool and provides the results of validation experiments performed in the context of an ongoing child autism neuroimaging study. The validation establishes SNAP intrarater and interrater reliability and overlap error statistics for the caudate nucleus and finds that SNAP is a highly reliable and efficient alternative to manual tracing. Analogous results for lateral ventricle segmentation are provided.},

abstract = {Abstract  Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) allows the visualization of cellular structures under close-to-life conditions and at molecular resolution. While it is inherently a static approach, yielding structural information about supramolecular organization at a certain time point, it can nevertheless provide insights into function of the structures imaged, in particular, when supplemented by other approaches. Here, we review the use of experimental methods that supplement cryo-ET imaging of whole cells. These include genetic and pharmacological manipulations, as well as correlative light microscopy and cryo-ET. While these methods have mostly been used to detect and identify structures visualized in cryo-ET or to assist the search for a feature of interest, we expect that in the future they will play a more important role in the functional interpretation of cryo-tomograms.},

Thirty swimmers who used to swim a distance of two to three kilometers per day regularly were compared with age, sex, height, and weight matched thirty middle distance runners. Runners and swimmers selected for this study were undergoing training since last three years. Tidal Volume (TV), forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV) were higher in swimmers than runners. Swimming exercise affects lung volume measurements as respiratory muscles including diaphragm of swimmers are required to develop greater pressure as a consequence of immersion in water during respiratory cycle, thus may lead to functional improvement in these muscles and also alterations in elasticity of lung and chest wall or of ventilatory muscles, leading to an improvement in forced vital capacity and other lung functions of swimmers than runners.},

abstract = {Perforations ("punctae") are one of the most characteristic morphological shell features in calcite brachiopods. The significance of punctae is that they represent discontinuities in shell biomineralisation and thus add a level of complexity that must be accounted for in any model of brachiopod shell formation. A significant hindrance to understanding punctae growth and formation is the absence of sufficient information on volume, size and density. Here, we use synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) to obtain three-dimensional information about punctae of five species of calcite brachiopods. X-ray tomography shows that punctae morphology is species-specific and reveals previously unknown levels of complexity for each species. This information is combined with previous data on morphology to discuss the function and growth of punctae. Overall the present study demonstrates the need to increase our understanding of discontinuities and the role of cell biology in the context of biomineralisation.},

abstract = {Recent studies have investigated histological staining compounds as micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) contrast agents, delivered by soaking tissue specimens in stain and relying on passive diffusion for agent uptake. This study describes a perfusion approach using iodine or phosphotungstic acid (PTA) stains, delivered to an intact mouse, to capitalize on the microvasculature as a delivery conduit for parenchymal staining and direct contact for staining artery walls. Twelve C57BL/6 mice, arterially perfused with either 25{\%} Lugol's solution or 5{\%} PTA solution were scanned intact and reconstructed with 26 µm isotropic voxels. The animals were fixed and the heart and surrounding vessels were excised, embedded and scanned; isolated heart images were reconstructed with 13 µm isotropic voxels. Myocardial enhancement and artery diameters were measured. Both stains successfully enhanced the myocardium and vessel walls. Interestingly, Lugol's solution provided a significantly higher enhancement of the myocardium than PTA [2502 ± 437 vs 656 ± 178 Hounsfield units (HU); p {\textless} 0.0001], delineating myofiber architecture and orientation. There was no significant difference in vessel wall enhancement (Lugol's, 1036 ± 635 HU; PTA, 738 ± 124 HU; p = 0.29), but coronary arteries were more effectively segmented from the PTA-stained hearts, enabling segmented imaging of fifth- order coronary artery branches. The combination of whole mouse perfusion delivery and use of heavy metal-containing stains affords high-resolution imaging of the mouse heart and vasculature by micro-CT. The differential imaging patterns of Lugol's- and PTA-stained tissues reveals new opportunities for micro-analyses of cardiac and vascular tissues.

abstract = {At the TOMCAT (TOmographic Microscopy and Coherent rAdiology experimenTs) beamline of the Swiss Light Source with an energy range of 8-45 keV and voxel size from 0.37 µm to 7.4 µm, full tomographic datasets are typically acquired in 5 to 10 min. To exploit the speed of the system and enable high-throughput studies to be performed in a fully automatic manner, a package of automation tools has been developed. The samples are automatically exchanged, aligned, moved to the correct region of interest, and scanned. This task is accomplished through the coordination of Python scripts, a robot-based sample-exchange system, sample positioning motors and a CCD camera. The tools are suited for any samples that can be mounted on a standard SEM stub, and require no specific environmental conditions. Up to 60 samples can be analyzed at a time without user intervention. The throughput of the system is dependent on resolution, energy and sample size, but rates of four samples per hour have been achieved with 0.74 µm voxel size at 17.5 keV. The maximum intervention-free scanning time is theoretically unlimited, and in practice experiments have been running unattended as long as 53 h (the average beam time allocation at TOMCAT is 48 h per user). The system is the first fully automated high-throughput tomography station: mounting samples, finding regions of interest, scanning and reconstructing can be performed without user intervention. The system also includes many features which accelerate and simplify the process of tomographic microscopy.},

abstract = {Mechanical ventilation is not only a life saving treatment but can also cause negative side effects. One of the main complications is inflammation caused by overstretching of the alveolar tissue. Previously, studies investigated either global strains or looked into which states lead to inflammatory reactions in cell cultures. However, the connection between the global deformation, of a tissue strip or the whole organ, and the strains reaching the single cells lining the alveolar walls is unknown and respective studies are still missing. The main reason for this is most likely the complex, sponge-like alveolar geometry, whose three-dimensional details have been unknown until recently. Utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy, we were able to generate real and detailed three-dimensional alveolar geometries on which we have performed finite-element simulations. This allowed us to determine, for the first time, a three-dimensional strain state within the alveolar wall. Briefly, precision-cut lung slices, prepared from isolated rat lungs, were scanned and segmented to provide a three-dimensional geometry. This was then discretized using newly developed tetrahedral elements. The main conclusions of this study are that the local strain in the alveolar wall can reach a multiple of the value of the global strain, for our simulations up to four times as high and that thin structures obviously cause hotspots that are especially at risk of overstretching.},

abstract = {Vascularization is essential for many tissues and is a main requisite for various tissue-engineering strategies. Different techniques are used for highlighting vasculature, in vivo and ex vivo, in 2-D or 3-D including histological staining, immunohistochemistry, radiography, angiography, microscopy, computed tomography (CT) or micro-CT, both stand-alone and synchrotron system. Vascularization can be studied with or without a contrast agent. This paper presents the results obtained with the latest Skyscan micro-CT (Skyscan 1272, Bruker, Belgium) following barium sulphate injection replacing the bloodstream in comparison with results obtained with a Skyscan In Vivo 1076. Different hard and soft tissues were perfused with contrast agent and were harvested. Samples were analysed using both forms of micro-CT, and improved results were shown using this new micro-CT. This study highlights the vasculature using micro-CT methods. The results obtained with the Skyscan 1272 are clearly defined compared to results obtained with Skyscan 1076. In particular, this instrument highlights the high number of small vessels, which were not seen before at lower resolution. This new micro-CT opens broader possibilities in detection and characterization of the 3-D vascular tree to assess vascular tissue engineering strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES:: Phase-contrast and scattering-based x-ray imaging are known to provide additional and complementary information to conventional, absorption-based methods, and therefore have the potential to play a crucial role in medical diagnostics. We report on the first mammographic investigation of 5 native, that is, freshly dissected, breasts carried out with a grating interferometer and a conventional x-ray tube source. Four patients in this study had histopathologically proven invasive breast cancer. One male patient, without the presence of any malignant formations within the resected breast, was included as a control specimen. MATERIALS AND METHODS:: We used a Talbot-Lau grating setup installed on a conventional, low-brilliance x-ray source; the interferometer operated at the fifth Talbot distance, at a tube voltage of 40 kVp with mean energy of 28 keV, and at a current of 25 mA. The device simultaneously recorded absorption, differential phase and small-angle scattering signals from the native breast tissue. These quantities were then combined into novel color- and high-frequency-enhanced radiographic images. Presurgical images (conventional mammography, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging) supported the findings and clinical relevance was verified. RESULTS:: Our approach yields complementary and otherwise inaccessible information on the electron density distribution and the small-angle scattering power of the sample at the microscopic scale. This information can be used to potentially answer clinically relevant, yet unresolved questions such as unequivocally discerning between malignant and premalignant changes and postoperative scars and distinguishing cancer-invaded regions within healthy tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: We present the first ex vivo images of fresh, native breast tissue obtained from mastectomy specimens using grating interferometry. This technique yields improved diagnostic capabilities when compared with conventional mammography, especially when discerning the type of malignant conversions and their breadth within normal breast tissue. These promising results advance us toward the ultimate goal, using grating interferometry in vivo on humans in a clinical setting.},

abstract = {Volume averaging results in both over- and underestimation of airway dimensions when they are measured by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). The current authors calibrated computerised measurements of airway dimensions from HRCT against a novel three-dimensional micro-computed tomography (CT) standard, which has a 50-fold greater resolution, as well as against traditional morphometry. Inflation-fixed porcine lung cubes were scanned by HRCT and micro-CT. A total of 59 lumen area (Ai), 30 wall area (A(aw)) and 11 lumen volume (Vi) measurements were made. Ai was measured from the cut surface of 11 airways by morphometry. Airways in scanned images were matched using branching points. After calibration, the errors of Ai, A(aw) and Vi HRCT measurements were determined. The current authors found a systematic, size-dependent underestimation of Ai and overestimation of A(aw) from HRCT measurements. This was used to calibrate an HRCT measurement algorithm. The 95{\%} limits of agreement of subsequent measurements were +/-3.2 mm2 for Ai, +/-4.3 mm2 for A(aw), and +/-11.2 mm3 for Vi with no systematic error. Morphometric measurements agreed with micro-CT (+/-2.5 mm2) without systematic error. In conclusion, micro-computed tomography image data from inflation-fixed airways can be used as calibration standards for three-dimensional lumen volume measurements from high-resolution computed tomography, while morphometry is acceptable for two-dimensional measurements. The image dataset could be used to validate other developmental three-dimensional segmentation algorithms.},

@article{Khimchenko2016,
abstract = {Histological examination achieves sub-micrometer resolution laterally. In the third dimension, however, resolution is limited to section thickness. In addition, histological sectioning and mounting sections on glass slides introduce tissue-dependent stress and strain. In contrast, state-of-the-art hard X-ray micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) systems provide isotropic sub-micrometer resolution and avoid sectioning artefacts. The drawback of $\mu$CT in the absorption contrast mode for visualising physically soft tissue is a low attenuation difference between anatomical features. In this communication, we demonstrate that formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human cerebellum yields appropriate absorption contrast in laboratory-based $\mu$CT data, comparable to conventional histological sections. Purkinje cells, for example, are readily visible. In order to investigate the pros and cons of complementary approaches, two- and three-dimensional data were manually and automatically registered. The joint histogram of histology and the related $\mu$CT slice allows for a detailed discussion on how to integrate two-dimensional information from histology into a three-dimensional tomography dataset. This methodology is not only rewarding for the analysis of the human cerebellum, but it also has relevance for investigations of tissue biopsies and post-mortem applications. Our data indicate that laboratory-based $\mu$CT as a modality can fill the gap between synchrotron radiation-based $\mu$CT and histology for a variety of tissues. As the information from haematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E) stained sections and $\mu$CT data is related, one can colourise local X-ray absorption values according to the H{\&}E stain. Hence, $\mu$CT data can correlate and virtually extend two-dimensional (2D) histology data into the third dimension.},

abstract = {The inventor of computer tomography, Godfrey N. Hounsfield, mentioned
in his Nobel Foundation lecture the following three main problems
of conventional radiography: 1. It depicts the sum of shadows from
several tissue elements at the same spot of the film. 2. The sensitivity
of the employed photographic medium does not allow to differentiate
between various soft tissue densities. 3. It gives no exact measure
characterizing tissue densities. The first part of this article is
dealing with the solution of problem number one. Researchers within
medical imaging from many countries developed independently of each
other a variety of methods for body-sectional imaging methods, but
he did not construct any equipment. Alessandro Vallebona constructed
equipment and published the first clinical body-section imaging material
ever in 1930, but his method was not ideal. The first clinical material
employing an ideal method was published by Bernhard Ziedses des Plantes
in 1932. Methods for transverse axial tomography was independently
described by William Watson in 1937, Jean Kieffer in 1938, and Shinji
Takahashi in 1947. The limitation in sensitivity of the photographic
medium was revealed in parallel to this development. In 1963 Allan
M. Cormack described the mathematical model for absorption of ionizing
rays in inhomogenous tissue. Godfrey N. Hounsfield combined this
knowledge of mathematics with the fast developing computer technology
and the medical need for a more sensitive registration medium. In
1971 computer tomography was a reality. One of the greatest conquests
in medicine of this century had been made. Recent developments within
scanner technology predict still better and safer diagnostic possibilities.},

In rats, glucocorticoids are known to seriously impair the formation of alveoli when applied during the first two postnatal weeks even at very low dosage. The current study investigates short-term and long-term glucocorticoid effects on the rat lung by means of morphologic and morphometric observations at light and electron microscopic levels. Application of a high-dosage protocol for only few days resulted in a marked acceleration of lung development with a precocious microvascular maturation resulting in single capillary network septa in the first 4 postnatal days. By postnatal d 10, the lung morphologic phenotype showed a step back in the maturational state, with an increased number of septa with double capillary layer, followed by an exceptional second round of the alveolarization process. As a result of this process, there was an almost complete recovery in the parenchymal lung structure by postnatal d 36, and by d 60, there were virtually no qualitative or quantitative differences between experimental and control rats. These findings indicate that both dosage and duration of glucocorticoid therapy in the early postnatal period are very critical with respect to lung development and maturation and that a careful therapeutic strategy can minimize late sequelae of treatment.},

abstract = {The advances in preclinical cancer models, including orthotopic implantation models or genetically engineered mouse models of cancer, enable pursuing the molecular mechanism of cancer disease that might mimic genetic and biological processes in humans. Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer deaths; therefore, the treatment and prevention of lung cancer are expected to be improved by a better understanding of the complex mechanism of disease. In this study, we have examined the quantification of two distinct mouse lung cancer models by utilizing imaging modalities for monitoring tumor progression and drug efficacy evaluation. The utility of microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) for real-time/non-invasive monitoring of lung cancer progression has been confirmed by combining bioluminescent imaging and histopathological analyses. Further, we have developed a more clinically relevant lung cancer model by utilizing K-ras(LSL-G12D)/p53(LSL-R270H) mutant mice. Using micro-CT imaging, we monitored the development and progression of solitary lung tumor in K-ras(LSL-G12D)/p53(LSL-R270H) mutant mouse, and further demonstrated tumor growth inhibition by anticancer drug treatment. These results clearly indicate that imaging-guided evaluation of more clinically relevant tumor models would improve the process of new drug discovery and increase the probability of success in subsequent clinical studies.},

abstract = {The strength of bone tissue is not only determined by its mass, but also by other properties usually referred to as bone quality, such as microarchitecture, distribution of bone cells, or microcracks and damage. It has been hypothesized that the bone ultrastructure affects microcrack initiation and propagation. Due to its high resolution, bone assessment by means of synchrotron radiation (SR)-based computed tomography (CT) allows unprecedented three-dimensional (3D) and non-invasive insights into ultrastructural bone phenotypes, such as the canal network and the osteocyte lacunar system. The aims of this study were to describe the initiation and propagation of microcracks and their relation with these ultrastructural phenotypes. To this end, femora from the two genetically distinct inbred mouse strains C3H/He (C3H) and C57BL/6 (B6) were loaded axially under compression, from 0{\%} strain to failure, with 1{\%} strain steps. Between each step, a high-resolution 3D image (700 nm nominal resolution) was acquired at the mid-diaphysis using SR CT for characterization and quantitative analysis of the intracortical porosity, namely the bone canal network, the osteocyte lacunar system and the emerging microcracks. For C3H mice, the canal, lacunar, and microcrack volume densities accounted typically for 1.91{\%}, 2.11{\%}, and 0.27{\%} of the cortical total volume at 2{\%} apparent strain, respectively. Due to its 3D nature, SR CT allowed to visualize and quantify also the volumetric extent of microcracks. At 2{\%} apparent strain, the average microcrack thickness for both mouse strains was 2.0 microm for example. Microcracks initiated at canal and at bone surfaces, whereas osteocyte lacunae provided guidance to the microcracks. Moreover, we observed that microcracks could appear as linear cracks in one plane, but as diffuse cracks in a perpendicular plane. Finally, SR CT images permitted visualization of uncracked ligament bridging, which is thought to be of importance in bone toughening mechanisms. In conclusion, this study showed the power of SR CT for 3D visualization and quantification of the different ultrastructural phases of the intracortical bone porosity. We particularly postulate the necessity of 3D imaging techniques to unravel microcrack initiation and propagation and their effects on bone mechanics. We believe that this new investigation tool will be very useful to further enhance our understanding of bone failure mechanisms.},

abstract = {Micron-scale computed tomography (micro-CT) is an essential tool for phenotyping and for elucidating diseases and their therapies. This work is focused on preclinical micro-CT imaging, reviewing relevant principles, technologies, and applications. Commonly, micro-CT provides high-resolution anatomic information, either on its own or in conjunction with lower-resolution functional imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). More recently, however, advanced applications of micro-CT produce functional information by translating clinical applications to model systems (e.g. measuring cardiac functional metrics) and by pioneering new ones (e.g. measuring tumor vascular permeability with nanoparticle contrast agents). The primary limitations of micro-CT imaging are the associated radiation dose and relatively poor soft tissue contrast. We review several image reconstruction strategies based on iterative, statistical, and gradient sparsity regularization, demonstrating that high image quality is achievable with low radiation dose given ever more powerful computational resources. We also review two contrast mechanisms under intense development. The first is spectral contrast for quantitative material discrimination in combination with passive or actively targeted nanoparticle contrast agents. The second is phase contrast which measures refraction in biological tissues for improved contrast and potentially reduced radiation dose relative to standard absorption imaging. These technological advancements promise to develop micro-CT into a commonplace, functional and even molecular imaging modality. {\textcopyright} 2014 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica.},

abstract = {Perforator flaps have been increasingly used in the past few years for trauma and reconstructive surgical cases. With the thinned flap design, greater survivability and a decrease in donor site morbidity have been reported. Knowledge of the 3D vascular tree will provide insight information about the dissection region, vascular territory, and fascia levels. In this paper, we will propose a computational framework for the automatic 3D vascular tree construction. The computational framework begins with an image segmentation algorithm, spedge-and-medge, which is an integration of Canny edge detector, edge-linking, and split-and-merge to initially segment out the vessels from the background. To deal with the possible broken vessels, a vascular cross-sectional tree repairing and interpolation algorithm is then developed based on the 3D connectivity and root-converging properties of the tree branches. Furthermore, to extract the essential characteristics of the vascular structure, 3D thinning algorithms are used to build up the skeletons of the tree. At each stage of the framework, 3D rendering results are provided for the visualization of the computed results. The proposed method achieves good performance and has been used for the 3D vascular tree construction and surgical danger zone measurements on 39 harvested cadaver perforator flaps with the types of ALTP, GAP, and TAP.},

This review provides an overview of the current murine models used to study lung cancer and the advantages and limitations of each model, as well as a retrospective evaluation of the uses of each model with respect to accuracy in predicting clinical benefit of therapy.

abstract = {Purpose: To explore the effects of microbeam radiation (MR) on vascular biology, we used the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model of an almost pure vascular system with immature vessels (lacking periendothelial coverage) at Day 8 and mature vessels (with coverage) at Day 12 of development. Methods and Materials: CAMs were irradiated with microplanar beams (width, ∼25 $\mu$m; interbeam spacing, ∼200 $\mu$m) at entrance doses of 200 or 300 Gy and, for comparison, with a broad beam (seamless radiation [SLR]), with entrance doses of 5 to 40 Gy. Results: In vivo monitoring of Day-8 CAM vasculature 6 h after 200 Gy MR revealed a near total destruction of the immature capillary plexus. Conversely, 200 Gy MR barely affected Day-12 CAM mature microvasculature. Morphological evaluation of Day-12 CAMs after the dose was increased to 300 Gy revealed opened interendothelial junctions, which could explain the transient mesenchymal edema immediately after irradiation. Electron micrographs revealed cytoplasmic vacuolization of endothelial cells in the beam path, with disrupted luminal surfaces; often the lumen was engorged with erythrocytes and leukocytes. After 30 min, the capillary plexus adopted a striated metronomic pattern, with alternating destroyed and intact zones, corresponding to the beam and the interbeam paths within the array. SLR at a dose of 10 Gy caused growth retardation, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the vascular endpoint density 24 h postirradiation. A dose of 40 Gy damaged the entire CAM vasculature. Conclusions: The effects of MR are mediated by capillary damage, with tissue injury caused by insufficient blood supply. Vascular toxicity and physiological effects of MR depend on the stage of capillary maturation and appear in the first 15 to 60 min after irradiation. Conversely, the effects of SLR, due to the arrest of cell proliferation, persist for a longer time. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {For liver surgical planning, the structure and morphology of the hepatic vessels and their relationship to tumors are of major interest. To achieve a fast and robust assistance with optimal quantitative and visual information, we present methods for a geometrical and structural analysis of vessel systems. Starting from the raw image data a sequence of image processing steps has to be carried out until a three-dimensional representation of the relevant anatomic and pathologic structures is generated. Based on computed tomography (CT) scans, the following steps are performed. 1) The volume data is preprocessed and the vessels are segmented. 2) The skeleton of the vessels is determined and transformed into a graph enabling a geometrical and structural shape analysis. Using this information the different intrahepatic vessel systems are identified automatically. 3) Based on the structural analysis of the branches of the portal vein, their vascular territories are approximated with different methods. These methods are compared and validated anatomically by means of corrosion casts of human livers. 4) Vessels are visualized with graphics primitives fitted to the skeleton to provide smooth visualizations without aliasing artifacts. The image analysis techniques have been evaluated in the clinical environment and have been used in more than 170 cases so far to plan interventions and transplantations.},

abstract = {Pre- and postnatal corticosteroids are often used in perinatal medicine to improve pulmonary function in preterm infants. To mimic this clinical situation, newborn rats were treated systemically with dexamethasone (Dex), 0.1-0.01 mg/kg/day on days P1-P4. We hypothesized that postnatal Dex may have an impact on alveolarization by interfering with extracellular matrix proteins and cellular differentiation. Morphological alterations were observed on 3D images obtained by high-resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy. Alveolarization was quantified stereologically by estimating the formation of new septa between days P4 and P60. The parenchymal expression of tenascin-C (TNC), smooth muscle actin (SMA), and elastin was measured by immunofluorescence and gene expression for TNC by qRT-PCR. After Dex treatment, the first phase of alveolarization was significantly delayed between days P6 and P10, whereas the second phase was accelerated. Elastin and SMA expressions were delayed by Dex treatment, whereas TNC expression was delayed and prolonged. A short course of neonatal steroids impairs the first phase of alveolarization, most likely by altering the TNC and elastin expression. Due to an overshooting catch-up during the second phase of alveolarization, the differences disappear when the animals reach adulthood.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a simple and useful injection protocol for imaging cadaveric vascularization and dissection. Mixtures of contrast agent and cast product should provide adequate contrast for two types of ex vivo imaging (MRI and CT) and should harden to allow gross dissection of the injected structures. We tested the most popular contrast agents and cast products, and selected the optimal mixture composition based on their availability and ease of use. All mixtures were first tested in vitro to adjust dilution parameters of each contrast agent and to fine-tune MR imaging acquisition sequences. Mixtures were then injected in 24 pig livers and one human pancreas for MR and computed tomography (CT) imaging before anatomical dissection. Colorized latex, gadobutrol and barite mixture met the above objective. Mixtures composed of copper sulfate (CuSO4 ) gadoxetic acid (for MRI) and iodine (for CT) gave an inhomogeneous signal or extravasation of the contrast agent. Agar did not harden sufficiently for gross dissection but appears useful for CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies without dissection. Silicone was very hard to inject but achieved the goals of the study. Resin is particularly difficult to use but could replace latex as an alternative for corrosion instead of dissection. This injection protocol allows CT and MRI images to be obtained of cadaveric vascularization and anatomical casts in the same anatomic specimen. Post-imaging processing software allow easy 3D reconstruction of complex anatomical structures using this technique. Applications are numerous, e.g. surgical training, teaching methods, postmortem anatomic studies, pathologic studies, and forensic diagnoses.},

abstract = {Morphometric investigations using a point and intersection counting strategy in the lung often are not able to reveal the full set of morphologic changes. This happens particularly when structural modifications are not expressed in terms of volume density changes and when rough and fine surface density alterations cancel each other at different magnifications. Making use of digital image processing, we present a methodological approach that allows to easily and quickly quantify changes of the geometrical properties of the parenchymal lung structure and reflects closely the visual appreciation of the changes. Randomly sampled digital images from light microscopic sections of lung parenchyma are filtered, binarized, and skeletonized. The lung septa are thus represented as a single-pixel wide line network with nodal points and end points and the corresponding internodal and end segments. By automatically counting the number of points and measuring the lengths of the skeletal segments, the lung architecture can be characterized and very subtle structural changes can be detected. This new methodological approach to lung structure analysis is highly sensitive to morphological changes in the parenchyma: it detected highly significant quantitative alterations in the structure of lungs of rats treated with a glucocorticoid hormone, where the classical morphometry had partly failed.},

@article{Cavanaugh2006,
abstract = {Rationale and Objectives: We explored noninvasive, in vivo cone-beam microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) to visualize and quantify fibrotic and inflammatory damage over the entire lung volume of mice. Materials and Methods: We used bleomycin to induce pulmonary damage in vivo and compared the results from micro-CT with histologic measurements. Ten C57BL/6 mice were given 5 U/kg bleomycin intratracheally. Seven surviving mice were scanned with micro-CT before administration of bleomycin, and again before sacrifice. The resulting images were analyzed for lung volume measurements. After the final scan, all lungs were examined histologically and pulmonary damage was quantified. Damaged lung tissue regions were matched between micro-CT images and histologic sections for each mouse. Results: The percent lung damage calculated from micro-CT and histology were correlated (r2= 0.49, r = 0.64 with P = 0.12), and the means of their respective distributions were not different (P {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion: This study shows that micro-CT is a promising alternative to predicting lung damage caused by bleomycin. CT image volumes of the thorax allow for global tissue sampling, which may be useful when following nonuniform lung damage that can occur from intratracheal administration of bleomycin. {\textcopyright} 2006 AUR.},

abstract = {The future demands of computed tomographyimaging regarding the x-ray source can be summarized with higher scan power, shorter rotation times, shorter cool down times and smaller focal spots. We report on a new tube technology satisfying all these demands by making use of a novel cooling principle on one hand and of a novel beam control system on the other hand. Nowadays tubes use a rotating anode disk mainly cooled via radiation. The Straton{\textregistered}x-ray tube is the first tube available for clinical routine utilizing convective cooling exclusively. It is demonstrated that this cooling principle makes large heat storage capacities of the anode disk obsolete. The unprecedented cooling rate of 4.8 MHU/min eliminates the need for waiting times due to anode cooling in clinical workflow. Moreover, an electronic beam deflection system for focal spot position and size control opens the door to advanced applications. The physical backgrounds are discussed and the technical realization is presented. From this discussion the superior suitability of this tube to withstand g-forces well above 20 g created by fast rotating gantries will become evident. Experience from a large clinical trial is reported and possible ways for future developments are discussed.},

abstract = {The intratracheal instillation of bleomycin in mice induces early damage to alveolar epithelial cells and development of inflammation followed by fibrotic tissue changes and represents the most widely used model of pulmonary fibrosis to investigate human IPF. Histopathology is the gold standard for assessing lung fibrosis in rodents, however it precludes repeated and longitudinal measurements of disease progression and does not provide information on spatial and temporal distribution of tissue damage. Here we investigated the use of the Micro-CT technique to allow the evaluation of disease onset and progression at different time-points in the mouse bleomycin model of lung fibrosis. Micro-CT was throughout coupled with histological analysis for the validation of the imaging results. In bleomycin-instilled and control mice, airways and lung morphology changes were assessed and reconstructed at baseline, 7, 14 and 21 days post-treatment based on Micro-CT images. Ashcroft score, percentage of collagen content and percentage of alveolar air area were detected on lung slides processed by histology and subsequently compared with Micro-CT parameters. Extent ({\%}) of fibrosis measured by Micro-CT correlated with Ashcroft score, the percentage of collagen content and the percentage of alveolar air area (r 2 = 0.91; 0.77; 0.94, respectively). Distal airway radius also correlated with the Ashcroft score, the collagen content and alveolar air area percentage (r 2 = 0.89; 0.78; 0.98, respectively). Micro-CT data were in good agreement with histological read-outs as micro-CT was able to quantify effectively and non-invasively disease progression longitudinally and to reduce the variability and number of animals used to assess the damage. This suggests that this technique is a powerful tool for understanding experimental pulmonary fibrosis and that its use could translate into a more efficient drug discovery process, also helping to fill the gap between preclinical setting and clinical practice.},

abstract = {Characterisation and quantification of tissue structures is limited by sectioning-induced artefacts and by the difficulties of visualising and segmenting 3D volumes. Here we demonstrate that, even in the absence of X-ray contrast agents, X-ray computed microtomography (microCT) and nanotomography (nanoCT) can circumvent these problems by rapidly resolving compositionally discrete 3D tissue regions (such as the collagen-rich adventitia and elastin-rich lamellae in intact rat arteries) which in turn can be segmented due to their different X-ray opacities and morphologies. We then establish, using X-ray tomograms of both unpressurised and pressurised arteries that intra-luminal pressure not only increases lumen cross-sectional area and straightens medial elastic lamellae but also induces profound remodelling of the adventitial layer. Finally we apply microCT to another human organ (skin) to visualise the cell-rich epidermis and extracellular matrix-rich dermis and to show that conventional histological and immunohistochemical staining protocols are compatible with prior X-ray exposure. As a consequence we suggest that microCT could be combined with optical microscopy to characterise the 3D structure and composition of archival paraffin embedded biological materials and of mechanically stressed dynamic tissues such as the heart, lungs and tendons.},

abstract = {Digital x-ray detectors are now the detector of choice in many X-ray examinations. They have been accepted into clinical practice over the past decade but there are still ongoing developments in the technology. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensors (APS) are a novel digital technology that offers advantages compared to some of the more established approaches (charge-coupled devices (CCD), thin film transistor arrays (TFT) and CMOS passive pixel sensors (PPS)). This thesis looks at the performance of these new sensors and attempts to identify their role in future medical imaging applications. Standard electro-optical and x-ray performance evaluations of two novel CMOS APS, namely the large Area Sensor (LAS) and Dexela CMOS x-ray detector, are presented. The evaluation was made in terms of the photon transfer curve (PTC), the modulation transfer function (MTF), the normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS) and the resultant detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Modifications were introduced to extend the standard methods to overcome technical limitations. The performance of these detectors was compared to three commercial systems (Remote RadEye HR (CMOS APS), Hamamatsu C9732DK (CMOS PPS) and Anrad SMAM (a-Se TFT)) at beam qualities (28 kV for mammography and 52 kV and 74 kV for general radiography) based on the IEC standards. Both the LAS and Dexela CMOS detectors demonstrate enhanced performance. The effect of the CMOS APS inherent nonlinearity on the x-ray performance was also evaluated. Finally, the measured performance parameters were used to simulate images for different mammographic imaging tasks in order to establish possible areas of application for the new sensors. Two software phantoms (one representing a 3-D breast and the other the CDMAM test tool) were used to simulate a range of mammographic conditions. The results show that both novel CMOS APS detectors offer high image quality compared to the commercial detector systems.},

abstract = {Roughly 90{\%} of the gas-exchange surface is formed by alveolarization of the lungs. To the best of our knowledge, the formation of new alveoli has been followed in rats only by means of morphological description or interpretation of semiquantitative data until now. Therefore, we estimated the number of alveoli in rat lungs between postnatal days 4 and 60 by unambiguously counting the alveolar openings. We observed a bulk formation of new alveoli between days 4 and 21 (17.4 times increase from 0.8 to 14.3 millions) and a second phase of continued alveolarization between days 21 and 60 (1.3 times increase to 19.3 million). The (number weighted) mean volume of the alveoli decreases during the phase of bulk alveolarization from ∼593,000 $\mu$m(3) at day 4 to ∼141,000 $\mu$m(3) at day 21, but increases again to ∼298,000 $\mu$m(3) at day 60. We conclude that the "bulk alveolarization" correlates with the mechanism of classical alveolarization (alveolarization before the microvascular maturation is completed) and that the "continued alveolarization" follows three proposed mechanisms of late alveolarization (alveolarization after microvascular maturation). The biphasic pattern is more evident for the increase in alveolar number than for the formation of new alveolar septa (estimated as the length of the free septal edge). Furthermore, a striking negative correlation between the estimated alveolar size and published data on retention of nanoparticles was detected.},

In biomedical applications, micro-computed tomography (CT) scanners can function as scaled-down (i.e., mini) clinical CT scanners that provide a three-dimensional (3-D) image of most, if not the entire, torso of a mouse at image resolution (50-100 microm) scaled proportional to that of a human CT image. Micro-CT scanners, on the other hand, image specimens the size of intact rodent organs at spatial resolutions from cellular (20 microm) down to subcellular dimensions (e.g., 1 microm) and fill the resolution-hiatus between microscope imaging, which resolves individual cells in thin sections of tissue, and mini-CT imaging of intact volumes.},

abstract = {This study investigates the impact of ice-templating conditions on the morphological features of composite polysaccharide aerogels in relation to their mechanical behavior and aims to get a better insight into the parameters governing these properties. We have prepared polysaccharide aerogels of guar galactomannan (GM) and tamarind seed xyloglucan (XG) by enzymatic oxidation with galactose oxidase (GaO) to form hydrogels, followed by conventional and unidirectional ice-templating (freezing) methods and lyophilization to form aerogels. Composite polysaccharide aerogels were prepared by incorporating nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) into polysaccharide solutions prior to enzymatic oxidation and gel formation; such a cross linking technique enabled the homogeneous distribution of the NFC reinforcement into the gel matrix. We conducted phase-enhanced synchrotron X-ray microtomography (XMT) scans and visualized the internal microstructure of the aerogels in three-dimensional (3D) space. Volume-weighted pore-size and pore-wall thickness distributions were quantitatively measured and correlated to the aerogels' mechanical properties regarding ice-templating conditions. Pore-size distribution and orientation depended on the ice-templating methods and the NFC reinforcement that significantly determined the mechanical and shape-recovery behavior of the aerogels. The results obtained will guide the design of the microporous structure of polysaccharide aerogels with optimal morphology and mechanical behavior for life-sciences applications.},

abstract = {Pulmonary acinus is the largest airway unit provided with alveoli where blood/gas exchange takes place. Understanding the complete structure of acinus is necessary to measure the pathway of gas exchange and to simulate various mechanical phenomena in the lungs. The usual manual segmentation of a complete acinus structure from their experimentally obtained images is difficult and extremely time-consuming, which hampers the statistical analysis. In this study, we develop a semiautomatic segmentation algorithm for extracting the complete structure of acinus from synchrotron micro-CT images of the closed chest of mouse lungs. The algorithm uses a combination of conventional binary image processing techniques based on the multiscale and hierarchical nature of lung structures. Specifically, larger structures are removed, while smaller structures are isolated from the image by repeatedly applying erosion and dilation operators in order, adjusting the parameter referencing to previously obtained morphometric data. A cluster of isolated acini belonging to the same terminal bronchiole is obtained without floating voxels. The extracted acinar models above 98{\%} agree well with those extracted manually. The run time is drastically shortened compared with manual methods. These findings suggest that our method may be useful for taking samples used in the statistical analysis of acinus.},

Since modern desktop microCT-scanners provide the necessary detail resolution, we developed an approach for rapid visualization and consistent assessment of kidney vasculature and glomeruli number. This method is based on $\mu$Angiofil{\textregistered}, a new polymerizing contrast agent with homogenous X-ray absorption, which provides continuous filling of the complete vasculature and enables correlative imaging approaches. For rapid and reliable kidney morphometry the microangioCT-datasets from GDNF+/- mice and their wildtype littermates were used. The results were obtained much faster compared to the current gold standard, histology-based stereology, and without processing artefacts. The histology-based morphometry was afterwards done on the same kidneys. Both approaches revealed that the GDNF+/- male mice had more than 30{\%} fewer glomeruli. Futhermore,...},

Furthermore, MRT is conceptually similar to macroscopic grid based radiation therapy which has been used in clinical practice for decades. In this review, the potential clinical applications of MRT are analysed for both malignant and non-malignant diseases.},

abstract = {Various medical image compression techniques have been proposed for accelerating image propagation in many applications. JPEG2000 is a new generation technique that can encode near lossless ultrasound images at medium bit-rate with diagnostically acceptable quality. Because the coder of JPEG2000 is based on wavelet transform, the reconstructed image will contain some ringing artifacts. Some de-ringing algorithm must be applied to enhance image quality. This study presents quad-tree decomposition and a set of morphological filters for reducing the ringing artifacts of ultrasound images. Specifically, the presented morphological filters use eight predefined morphological operations, including four structuring elements (SE) that include both dilation and erosion. The proposed voting strategy can be used to select the morphological filter for each block to optimize decoded image quality. Image quality can be enhanced by applying the appropriate morphological filter to each block. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique enhances reconstructed ultrasound image quality compared to JPEG2000 at the same bit-rate in terms of both PSNR and the perceptual results.},

The engineering of composite-particle catalysts through the tuning of pore-size distribution and connectivity is hampered by the inability to visualize structure and porosity at critical-length scales. Herein, it is shown that the combination of phase-contrast X-ray microtomography and high-resolution ptychographic X-ray tomography allows the visualization and characterization of the interparticle pores at micro- and nanometer-length scales. Furthermore, individual components in preshaped catalyst bodies used in fluid catalytic cracking, one of the most used catalysts, could be visualized and identified.

The fraction of total lung resistance caused by airway resistance is difficult to quantify in vivo. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) has potential application for directly measuring changes in airway size in vivo. In the present investigation, we studied five anesthetized mongrel dogs using HRCT to locate and measure changes in airway area after aerosol histamine challenge in the absence and presence of deep inspiration. We also related changes in total lung resistance to changes in airway area. We found that in all dogs after histamine aerosol challenge, airway area decreased (range, 23 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 5{\%}, mean +/- SEM), and total lung resistance increased (range, 191 to 378{\%}). After deep inspiration (equal to three times tidal volume), four of the five dogs showed further significant decreases in airway area (range, 13 +/- 6 to 71 +/- 8{\%}), whereas all five dogs showed decreases in RL (range, 3 to 35{\%}). The fact that preconstricted airways constricted further after deep inspiration while the measured RL decreased suggests that RL may not always be a reliable indicator of changes in the size of conducting airways larger than 1 mm.},

abstract = {Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is a new form of preclinical radiotherapy using quasi-parallel arrays of synchrotron X-ray microbeams. While the deposition of several hundred Grays in the microbeam paths, the normal brain tissues presents a high tolerance which is accompanied by the permanence of apparently normal vessels. Conversely, the efficiency of MRT on tumor growth control is thought to be related to a preferential damaging of tumor blood vessels.The high resistance of the healthy vascular network was demonstrated in different animal models by i. n vivo biphoton microscopy, magnetic resonance imaging, and histological studies. While a transient increase in permeability was shown, the structure of the vessels remained intact. The use of a chick chorioallantoic membrane at different stages of development showed that the damages induced by microbeams depend on vessel maturation. In vivo and ultrastructural observations showed negligible effects of microbeams on the mature vasculature at late stages of development; nevertheless a complete destruction of the immature capillary plexus was found in the microbeam paths. The use of MRT in rodent models revealed a preferential effect on tumor vessels. Although no major modification was observed in the vasculature of normal brain tissue, tumors showed a denudation of capillaries accompanied by transient increased permeability followed by reduced tumor perfusion and finally, a decrease in number of tumor vessels. Thus, MRT is a very promising treatment strategy with pronounced tumor control effects most likely based on the anti-vascular effects of MRT.},

abstract = {The development of rat lung from a primitive gas-exchange organ to the mature respiratory organ is in large part a postnatal phenomenon that has been well characterized by morphological and morphometric methods. The alveolarization of the lung is achieved during the first 3 weeks of life. Cholinergic innervation of rat lung also appears postnatally. We have monitored the presence or activity of several proteins during postnatal rat lung development. Newborn-rat lung contains negligible amounts of acetylcholinesterase, but the specific activity of acetylcholinesterase reaches adult values by postnatal day 10-11. Neonatal-rat lung does not contain significant amounts of beta-galactoside-binding protein [Powell (1980) Biochem. J.187, 123-129]. The activity of this endogenous lung lectin was apparent at about day 6, was maximal between days 10 and 13 before declining 8-10-fold to reach adult values. Elastin has been implicated from morphological evidence as critical to lung restructuring. We have quantified the amount of desmosine and isodesmosine per g wet wt. of lung. The concentration of elastin, by this criterion, was low and stationary until postnatal day 7; a dramatic increase in elastin concentration occurred between days 10 and 20, when adult values were reached. The peak of lung-lectin activity was coincident with the maturation of acetylcholinesterase and the beginning of rapid elastin cross-linking. The specific activities of angiotensin-converting enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, choline kinase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase were also monitored.},

We assessed the diagnostic performance of this system for abdominal CT interpretation. Performance was compared with an emergency department clinical monitor using a DICOM viewer. A total of 100 abdominal CT examinations were presented to four observers. There were 56 examinations showing appendicitis and 44 which were normal. The observers viewed the images using a UMPC display and an LCD monitor and rated each examination on a five-point scale. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to test for differences. The sensitivity and specificities of all observers were similarly high. The average area under the ROC curve for readings performed on the UMPC and the LCD monitor was 0.959 and 0.976, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two display systems for interpreting abdominal CTs. The web-based mobile teleradiology system appears to be feasible for reading abdominal CTs for diagnosing appendicitis and may be valuable in emergency teleconsultation.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 the American Physiological Society.Through interior tomography, high-resolution microcomputed tomography (CT) systems provide the ability to nondestructively assess the pulmonary acinus at micron and submicron resolutions. With the application of systematic uniform random sampling (SURS) principles applied to in situ fixed, intact, ex vivo lungs, we have sought to characterize morphometric differences in central vs. surface acini to better understand how well surface acini reflect global acinar geometry. Lungs from six mice (A/J strain, 15-20 wk of age) were perfusion fixed in situ and imaged using a multiresolution CT system (Micro XCT 400, Zeiss). With the use of lower-resolution whole lung images, SURS methods were used for identification of central and surface foci for high-resolution imaging. Acinar morphometric metrics included diameters, lengths, and branching angles for each alveolar duct and total path lengths from entrance of the acinus to the terminal alveolar sacs. In addition, acinar volume, alveolar surface area, and surface area/volume ratios were assessed. A generation-based analysis demonstrated that central acini have significantly smaller branch diameters at each generation with no significant increase in branch lengths. In addition to larger-diameter alveolar ducts, surface acini had significantly increased numbers of branches and terminal alveolar sacs. The total path lengths from the acinar entrance to the terminal nodes were found to be higher in the case of surface acini. Volumes and surface areas of surface acini are greater than central acini, but there were no differences in surface/volume ratios. In conclusion, there are significant structural differences between surface and central acini in the A/J mouse.},

The methods of choice for microscopy-based lung morphometry are those of stereology, the science of quantitative characterization of irregular three-dimensional objects on the basis of measurements made on two-dimensional sections. From a practical perspective, stereology is an assumption-free set of methods of unbiased sampling with geometric probes, based on a solid mathematical foundation. Here, we discuss the pitfalls of lung morphometry and present solutions, from specimen preparation to the sampling scheme in multiple stages, for obtaining unbiased estimates of morphometric parameters such as volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers. This is demonstrated on various examples. Stereological methods are accurate, efficient, simple, and transparent; the precision of the estimates depends on the size and distribution of the sample. For obtaining quantitative data on lung structure at all microscopic levels, state-of-the-art stereology is the gold standard.},

A 3D realistic model of multi-branching small airways was reconstructed from X-ray CT images of a mouse, which were obtained by the high-resolution synchrotron radiation CT system of SPring-8. Airway diameters range from 360 $\mu$m in the primary branch to 55 $\mu$m in the distal branch. The airway model was expanded and contracted in a sinusoidal volume change with time such that the geometry remains self-similar throughout a period. The Fluent software package was used for calculation of the fluid particle trajectory in the airway model. The dispersion of the fluid particle was evaluated in terms of the variance of the marked minute particles in the axial direction. The results show that the axial dispersion is enhanced by the expanding and contracting motion of the airways. It was also found that the augmentation of steady streaming is responsible for enhanced dispersion of fluid particles.},

abstract = {Silicone rubber corrosion casts of the human lung in a state of end inspiration were used to study several specimens of the human pulmonary acinus. Four of the acini were measured in detail with respect to duct length and diameter, the number of alveoli per duct, and the branching pattern of the ducts. The acini were found to have irregular branching patterns, including dichotomous, trichotomous, and side branches. There were, on the average, eight to 12 duct generations and about 7.1 X 10(3) alveoli per acinus. The polygonal alveoli had an average diameter of 250 micrometers. The lengths and diameters of the ducts varied considerably; however, the dimensions tended to decrease in the more proximal portions of the acini. The number of alveoli per duct also varied, with an average of ten alveoli per duct. On the basis of measurements, two models, a "surrogate path" model and an model being more useful for calculations such as particle deposition in the airways, and the average path model being most illustrative of the anatomical structures.},

abstract = {Sub-second temporal-resolution tomographic microscopy is becoming a reality at third-generation synchrotron sources. Efficient data handling and post-processing is, however, difficult when the data rates are close to 10 GB s(-1). This bottleneck still hinders exploitation of the full potential inherent in the ultrafast acquisition speed. In this paper the fast reconstruction algorithm gridrec, highly optimized for conventional CPU technology, is presented. It is shown that gridrec is a valuable alternative to standard filtered back-projection routines, despite being based on the Fourier transform method. In fact, the regridding procedure used for resampling the Fourier space from polar to Cartesian coordinates couples excellent performance with negligible accuracy degradation. The stronger dependence of the observed signal-to-noise ratio for gridrec reconstructions on the number of angular views makes the presented algorithm even superior to filtered back-projection when the tomographic problem is well sampled. Gridrec not only guarantees high-quality results but it provides up to 20-fold performance increase, making real-time monitoring of the sub-second acquisition process a reality.},

abstract = {Iodine imparts strong contrast to objects imaged with electrons and X-rays due to its high atomic number (53), and is widely used in liquid form as a microscopic stain and clinical contrast agent. We have developed a simple technique which exploits elemental iodine's sublimation-deposition state-change equilibrium to vapor stain specimens with iodine gas. Specimens are enclosed in a gas-tight container along with a small mass of solid I2 . The bottle is left at ambient laboratory conditions while staining proceeds until empirically determined completion (typically days to weeks). We demonstrate the utility of iodine vapor staining by applying it to resin-embedded tissue blocks and whole locusts and imaging them with backscattered electron scanning electron microscopy (BSE SEM) or X-ray microtomography (XMT). Contrast is comparable to that achieved with liquid staining but without the consequent tissue shrinkage, stain pooling, or uneven coverage artefacts associated with immersing the specimen in iodine solutions. Unmineralized tissue histology can be read in BSE SEM images with good discrimination between tissue components. Organs within the locust head are readily distinguished in XMT images with particularly useful contrast in the chitin exoskeleton, muscle and nerves. Here, we have used iodine vapor staining for two imaging modalities in frequent use in our laboratories and on the specimen types with which we work. It is likely to be equally convenient for a wide range of specimens, and for other modalities which generate contrast from electron- and photon-sample interactions, such as transmission electron microscopy and light microscopy.

The chest area of anesthesized mice was scanned by X-ray micro-CT. In mice with a minor and heavy tumor load, micro-CT proved to be a fast and noninvasive imaging device for the detection of lung tumors. After validation of the CT data by histologic sectioning, it was shown that the majority of tumors could be distinguished in the reconstructed virtual slices obtained by micro-CT. The data from micro-CT were also confirmed by visual inspection of the inflated and excised lungs postmortem. In vivo micro-CT opens broad perspectives for imaging tumor development and its progression in a noninvasive way. Micro-CT also allows for longitudinal evaluation of the treatment of lung cancer by drugs.},

abstract = {Hard facts on a soft matter! In their popular scientific book (Leyner M, Goldberg B. Why do men have nipples - hundreds of questions you'd only ask a doctor after your third martini. New York: Three Rivers Press; 2005), Leyner and Goldberg raised the question why "some belly buttons collect so much lint". They were, however, not able to come up with a satisfactory answer. The hypothesis presented herein says that abdominal hair is mainly responsible for the accumulation of navel lint, which, therefore, this is a typically male phenomenon. The abdominal hair collects fibers from cotton shirts and directs them into the navel where they are compacted to a felt-like matter. The most abundant individual mass of a piece of lint was found to be between 1.20 and 1.29 mg (n=503). However, due to several much larger pieces, the average mass was 1.82 mg in this three year study. When the abdominal hair is shaved, no more lint is collected. Old T-shirts or dress shirts produce less navel fuzz than brand new T-shirts. Using elemental analysis, it could be shown that cotton lint contains a certain amount of foreign material, supposedly cutaneous scales, fat or proteins. Incidentally, lint might thus fulfill a cleaning function for the navel.},

abstract = {In the study of asthma, a vital role is played by mouse models, because knockout or transgenic methods can be used to alter disease pathways and identify therapeutic targets that affect lung function. Assessment of lung function in rodents by available methods is insensitive because these techniques lack regional specificity. A more sensitive method for evaluating lung function in human asthma patients uses hyperpolarized (HP) (3)He MRI before and after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine (MCh). We now report the ability to perform such (3)He imaging of MCh response in mice, where voxels must be approximately 3000 times smaller than in humans and (3)He diffusion becomes an impediment to resolving the airways. We show three-dimensional (3D) images that reveal airway structure down to the fifth branching and visualize ventilation at a resolution of 125 x 125 x 1000 microm(3). Images of ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice acquired after MCh show both airway closure and ventilation loss. To also observe the MCh response in naive mice, we developed a non-slice-selective 2D protocol with 187 x 187 microm(2) resolution that was fast enough to record the MCh response and recovery with 12-s temporal resolution. The extension of (3)He MRI to mouse models should make it a valuable translational tool in asthma research.},

abstract = {Therapeutic modulation of angiogenesis is believed to be a prospective powerful treatment strategy to modulate the microcirculation and therefore help millions of patients with cardiovascular and cancer diseases. The often-frustrating results from late-stage clinical studies indicate an urgent need for improved assessment of the pro- and anti-angiogenic compounds in preclinical stage of investigation. For such a proper assessment, detailed vascular visualization and adequate quantification are essential. Nowadays, there are few imaging modalities available, but none of them provides non-destructive 3D-visualization of the vasculature down to the capillary level. In many instances, the approaches cannot be combined with the subsequent histological or ultrastructural analysis. In this review, we address the latest developments in the microvascular imaging, namely, the microangioCT approach with a polymer-based contrast agent ($\mu$Angiofil). This approach allows time-efficient non-destructive 3D-imaging of the organ and its vasculature including the finest capillaries. Besides the superior visualization, the obtained detailed 3D information on the organ vasculature enables its 3D-skeletonization and further quantitative analysis. Probably the only significant limitation of the described approach is that it can be used only ex vivo, i.e., no longitudinal studies. In spite of this drawback, microangioCT with $\mu$Angiofil is a relatively simple and straightforward tool with a broad application range for studying physiological and pathological alterations in the microvasculature of any organ. It provides microvascular imaging at unprecedented level and enables correlative microscopy.},

abstract = {Imaging with visible light today uses numerous contrast mechanisms, including bright- and dark-field contrast, phase-contrast schemes and confocal and fluorescence-based methods. X-ray imaging, on the other hand, has only recently seen the development of an analogous variety of contrast modalities. Although X-ray phase-contrast imaging could successfully be implemented at a relatively early stage with several techniques, dark-field imaging, or more generally scattering-based imaging, with hard X-rays and good signal-to-noise ratio, in practice still remains a challenging task even at highly brilliant synchrotron sources. In this letter, we report a new approach on the basis of a grating interferometer that can efficiently yield dark-field scatter images of high quality, even with conventional X-ray tube sources. Because the image contrast is formed through the mechanism of small-angle scattering, it provides complementary and otherwise inaccessible structural information about the specimen at the micrometre and submicrometre length scale. Our approach is fully compatible with conventional transmission radiography and a recently developed hard-X-ray phase-contrast imaging scheme. Applications to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing and security screening are discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a technique for determining the modulation transfer function (MTF) of an imaging system from an experimentally obtained edge profile. The technique includes an exact correction for the frequency passband of the finite-element differentiation required to obtain the line spread function from the edge spread function. This correction has been ignored by investigators in the past and is required whenever finite-element differentiation is used rather than analytic differentiation of a model fitted to the edge response data. The magnitude of the MTF correction is approximately 11{\%} at f = fc/2 and approximately 57{\%} at f = fc, where fc = fs/2 is the maximum frequency reproducible without aliasing with a sampling rate of fs. The correction is performed in the spatial frequency domain by multiplying the uncorrected MTF by 1/sinc (pi f/2fc). A computer simulation is presented to demonstrate the effect and the correction procedure. An experimental MTF of an x-ray image intensifier system obtained using this technique is found to be consistent with an MTF obtained using a bar pattern test phantom.},

abstract = {The identification and quantitative evaluation of lung tumors in mouse models is challenging and an unmet need in preclinical arena. In this study, we developed a noninvasive contrast-enhanced microCT ($\mu$CT) method to longitudinally evaluate and quantitate lung tumors in mice. Commercially available $\mu$CT contrast agents were compared to determine the optimal agent for visualization of thoracic blood vessels and lung tumors in na{\"{i}}ve mice and in non-small-cell lung cancer models. Compared with the saline control, iopamidol and iodinated lipid agents provided only marginal increases in contrast resolution. The inorganic nanoparticulate agent provided the best contrast and visualization of thoracic vascular structures; the density contrast was highest at 15 min after injection and was stable for more than 4 h. Differential contrast of the tumors, vascular structures, and thoracic air space by the nanoparticulate agent enabled identification of tumor margins and accurate quantification. $\mu$CT data correlated closely with traditional histologic measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.995). Treatment of ELM4-ALK mice with crizotinib yielded 65{\%} reduction in tumor size and thus demonstrated the utility of quantitative $\mu$CT in longitudinal preclinical trials. Overall and among the 3 agents we tested, the inorganic nanoparticulate product was the best commercially available contrast agent for visualization of thoracic blood vessels and lung tumors. Contrast-enhanced $\mu$CT imaging is an excellent noninvasive method for longitudinal evaluation during preclinical lung tumor studies.},

abstract = {Low currentx-ray tubes operating at 25–40kV have been developed using monolithic carbon nanotube(CNT) cold cathodes as electron sources. The authors have tested CNTcathodes from various sources. They were systematically evaluated and conditioned in a vacuum chamber and then went through high temperature baking and high voltage processing of standard tube production processes. Acceptance criteria were developed for each step in order to ensure that the final tube will meet the performance requirement of a commercial product. The tubes were subsequently operated continuously for an extended amount of time for life and reliability measurements. It was found that it is possible to use individually selected and preconditioned CNTcathodes in a commercial x-ray tube product. However, to find wide application and, particularly, to compete with existing hot filament thermionic cathodes,CNTcathodes need dramatic improvement in reproducibility and robustness. In addition, an empirical mathematical model for monolithic CNTcathodes has been developed for simulating the electron optics required in x-ray tubes. The model led to a successful design of a magnetically focused x-ray tube with a spot size of about 80$\mu$m.},

abstract = {Interventional and fluoroscopic imaging procedures for pediatric patients are becoming more prevalent because of the less-invasive nature of these procedures compared to alternatives such as surgery. Flat-panel X-ray detectors (FPD) for fluoroscopy are a new technology alternative to the image intensifier/TV (II/TV) digital system that has been in use for more than two decades. Two major FPD technologies have been implemented, based on indirect conversion of X-rays to light (using an X-ray scintillator) and then to proportional charge (using a photodiode), or direct conversion of X-rays into charge (using a semiconductor material) for signal acquisition and digitization. These detectors have proved very successful for high-exposure interventional procedures but lack the image quality of the II/TV system at the lowest exposure levels common in fluoroscopy. The benefits for FPD image quality include lack of geometric distortion, little or no veiling glare, a uniform response across the field-of-view, and improved ergonomics with better patient access. Better detective quantum efficiency indicates the possibility of reducing the patient dose in accordance with ALARA principles. However, first-generation FPD devices have been implemented with less than adequate acquisition flexibility (e.g., lack of tableside controls/information, inability to easily change protocols) and the presence of residual signals from previous exposures, and additional cost of equipment and long-term maintenance have been serious impediments to purchase and implementation. Technological advances of second generation and future hybrid FPD systems should solve many current issues. The answer to the question "how much better are they?" is "significantly better", and they are certainly worth consideration for replacement or new implementation of an imaging suite for pediatric fluoroscopy.},

We show these pores to be present but almost invariably filled with material when water and surfactant are preserved in frozen hydrated lung examined with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. In the normal mouse, 16 open empty pores per alveolus were found in instillation-fixed dried lung vs. less than 1 per alveolus in frozen hydrated lungs (P less than 0.001). In the normal rat, 13 pores were seen per alveolus in instillation-fixed dried lung vs. less than 1 per alveolus in frozen hydrated lungs (P less than 0.001). We suggest that pores of Kohn 1) function primarily as conduits for interalveolar movement of alveolar liquid, surfactant components, and macrophages, 2) provide distributed sites for tubular myelin storage without increasing gas diffusion pathway thickness in the alveolar subphase itself, and 3) do not function as pathways for collateral ventilation during normal breathing in the absence of atelectasis or obstruction.},

abstract = {Phase-sensitive X-ray imaging methods can provide substantially increased contrast over conventional absorption-based imaging, and therefore new and otherwise inaccessible information. Differential phase-contrast (DPC) imaging, which uses a grating interferometer and a phase-stepping technique, has been integrated into TOMCAT, a beamline dedicated to tomographic microscopy and coherent radiology experiments at the Swiss Light Source. Developments have been made focusing on the fast acquisition and post-processing of data to enable a high-throughput of samples, with obvious advantages, also through increasing the efficiency of the detecting system, of helping to reduce radiation dose imparted to the sample. A novel aquarium design allows a vertical rotation axis below the sample with measurements performed in aqueous environment. Optimization of the data acquisition procedure enables a full phase volume (1024 x 1024 pixels x 1000 projections x 9 phase steps, i.e. 9000 projections in total) to be acquired in 20 min (with a pixel size of 7.4 microm), and the subsequent post-processing has been integrated into the beamline pipeline for sinogram generation. Local DPC tomography allows one to focus with higher magnification on a particular region of interest of a sample without the presence of local tomography reconstruction artifacts. Furthermore, 'widefield' imaging is shown for DPC scans for the first time, enabling the field of view of the imaging system to be doubled for samples that are larger than the magnification allows. A case study is illustrated focusing on the visualization of soft tissue features, and particularly the substantia nigra of a rat brain. Darkfield images, based on local X-ray scattering, can also be extracted from a grating-based DPC scan: an example of the advantages of darkfield contrast is shown and the potential of darkfield X-ray tomography is discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The human cerebral cortex is supplied by vessels that arise from the pial arteries. These vessels give rise to a dense vascular network that is highly interconnected. Cortical arteries have been classified in different categories. Both their angioarchitectonic pattern and anatomical structures involved in their regulation are not fully understood. METHODS Twelve fresh human brains were studied by scanning electron microscopy of vascular corrosion casts. RESULTS Four types of arterial vessels in the cerebral cortex--short, middle, long, and transcortical--were identified. The cortical vascular network was formed by several interconnected clusters of vessels, which were arranged in four vascular layers parallel to the pial surface and characterized by different vascular densities. The greatest vascular density corresponded to the middle and deep vascular layers. Circular constrictions were found at the origin of cortical arteries and at their branching sites, probably related to vascular sphincters. Connections between cortical arteries were observed at their initial course. Plastic strips, occasionally related to constrictions, were observed around both middle and long cortical arteries. Other plastic structures, morphologically similar to pericytes, were found around capillary vessels. CONCLUSIONS The blood supply to the human cerebral cortex depends on the short, middle, and long cortical arteries, which give rise to a highly anastomosed capillary network. There exist vascular connections between pial arteries and occasionally between cortical arteries. Blood flow autoregulation is probably mediated by smooth muscle cells at the arteriolar level and by pericytes at the capillary level, through endothelial connections.},

abstract = {Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) is an irradiation modality for therapeutic purposes which uses arrays of collimated quasi parallel microbeams, each up to 100 ??m wide, to deliver high radiation doses. Several studies have reported the extraordinary tolerance of normal tissues to MRT irradiation; conversely, MRT has been shown to be highly efficient on tumor growth control. The original and most widely developed application of MRT, yet in the preclinical phase, consists in using spatially fractionated X-ray beams issued from a synchrotron radiation source in the treatment of brain tumors. More recently, MRT has been tested in successful pioneering assays to reduce or interrupt seizures in preclinical models of epilepsy. The MRT concept has also been extended to proton therapy. The development of MRT towards its clinical implementation is presently driven by an EU-supported consortium of laboratories from 16 countries within the COST Action TD1205 (SYRA3). The results of the first SYRA3 workshop on "Radiation Therapy with Synchrotron Radiation: Achievements and Challenges" held in Krakow (Poland) during March 25-26 2014 are summarized in this issue with an overview presented in this paper. The papers reflect the multidisciplinary international activities of SYRA3. The topics covered in this focus issue include medical physics aspects, pre-clinical studies, clinical applications, and an industrial perspective; finally an outlook towards future prospects of compact sources and proton microbeams.},

abstract = {The investigation of form-function relationships requires a detailed understanding of anatomical systems. Here we document the 3-dimensional morphology of the cranial musculoskeletal anatomy in the Australian Laughing Kookaburra Dacelo novaeguineae, with a focus upon the geometry and attachments of the jaw muscles in this species. The head of a deceased specimen was CT scanned, and an accurate 3D representation of the skull and jaw muscles was generated through manual segmentation of the CT scan images, and augmented by dissection of the specimen. We identified 14 major jaw muscles: 6 in the temporal group (M. adductor mandibulae and M. pseudotemporalis), 7 in the pterygoid group (M. pterygoideus dorsalis and M. pterygoideus ventralis), and the single jaw abductor M. depressor mandibulae. Previous descriptions of avian jaw musculature are hindered by limited visual representation and inconsistency in the nomenclature. To address these issues, we: (1) present the 3D model produced from the segmentation process as a digital, fully interactive model in the form of an embedded 3D image, which can be viewed from any angle, and within which major components can be set as opaque, transparent, or hidden, allowing the anatomy to be visualised as required to provide a detailed understanding of the jaw anatomy; (2) provide a summary of the nomenclature used throughout the avian jaw muscle literature. The approach presented here provides considerable advantages for the documentation and communication of detailed anatomical structures in a wide range of taxa.},

@article{Knudsen2007,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surfactant protein D (SP-D) deficient mice develop emphysema-like pathology associated with focal accumulations of foamy alveolar macrophages, an excess of surfactant phospholipids in the alveolar space and both hypertrophy and hyperplasia of alveolar type II cells. These findings are associated with a chronic inflammatory state. Treatment of SP-D deficient mice with a truncated recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) has been shown to decrease the lipidosis and alveolar macrophage accumulation as well as production of proinflammatory chemokines. The aim of this study was to investigate if rfhSP-D treatment reduces the structural abnormalities in parenchymal architecture and type II cells characteristic of SP-D deficiency. METHODS: SP-D knock-out mice, aged 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 9 weeks were treated with rfhSP-D for 9, 6 and 3 weeks, respectively. All mice were sacrificed at age 12 weeks and compared to both PBS treated SP-D deficient and wild-type groups. Lung structure was quantified by design-based stereology at the light and electron microscopic level. Emphasis was put on quantification of emphysema, type II cell changes and intracellular surfactant. Data were analysed with two sided non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. MAIN RESULTS: After 3 weeks of treatment, alveolar number was higher and mean alveolar size was smaller compared to saline-treated SP-D knock-out controls. There was no significant difference concerning these indices of pulmonary emphysema within rfhSP-D treated groups. Type II cell number and size were smaller as a consequence of treatment. The total volume of lamellar bodies per type II cell and per lung was smaller after 6 weeks of treatment. CONCLUSION: Treatment of SP-D deficient mice with rfhSP-D leads to a reduction in the degree of emphysema and a correction of type II cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy. This supports the concept that rfhSP-D might become a therapeutic option in diseases that are characterized by decreased SP-D levels in the lung.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the ability of multiparametric MRI to identify the early effects of individual treatment, during combined chemo-radiotherapy on brain tumours. Eighty male rats bearing 9L gliosarcomas were randomized into four groups: untreated, anti-angiogenic therapy (SORA group), microbeam radiation therapy (MRT group) and both treatments (MRT+SORA group). Multiparametric MRI (tumour volume, diffusion-weighted MR imaging (ADC), blood volume fraction (BVf), microvessel index (VSI), vessel wall integrity (AUCP846 ) and tissue oxygen saturation (StO2 )) was performed 1 day before and 2, 5 and 8 days after treatment initiation. Unpaired t-tests and one-way ANOVA were used for statistical analyses. Each MR parameter measured in our protocol was revealed to be sensitive to tumour changes induced by any of the therapies used (individually or combined). When compared with untreated tumours, SORA induced a decrease in BVf, VSI, StO2 and AUCP846 , MRT generated an increase in ADC and AUCP846 and combined therapies yielded mixed effects: an increase in ADC and AUCP846 and a decrease in BVf, StO2 and AUCP846 . MRT and MRT+SORA significantly slowed tumour growth. Despite these two groups presenting with similar tumour sizes, the information yielded from MR multiparameter assessment indicated that, when used concomitantly, each therapy induced distinguishable and appreciable physiological changes in the tumour. Our results suggest that multiparametric MRI can monitor the effects of individual treatments, used concomitantly, on brain tumours. Such monitoring would be useful for the detection of tumour resistance to drug/radiotherapy in patients undergoing concomitant therapies. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Donoghue2006,
abstract = {Fossilized embryos from the late Neoproterozoic and earliest Phanerozoic have caused much excitement because they preserve the earliest stages of embryology of animals that represent the initial diversification of metazoans. However, the potential of this material has not been fully realized because of reliance on traditional, non-destructive methods that allow analysis of exposed surfaces only, and destructive methods that preserve only a single two-dimensional view of the interior of the specimen. Here, we have applied synchrotron-radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM), obtaining complete three-dimensional recordings at submicrometre resolution. The embryos are preserved by early diagenetic impregnation and encrustation with calcium phosphate, and differences in X-ray attenuation provide information about the distribution of these two diagenetic phases. Three-dimensional visualization of blastomere arrangement and diagenetic cement in cleavage embryos resolves outstanding questions about their nature, including the identity of the columnar blastomeres. The anterior and posterior anatomy of embryos of the bilaterian worm-like Markuelia confirms its position as a scalidophoran, providing new insights into body-plan assembly among constituent phyla. The structure of the developing germ band in another bilaterian, Pseudooides, indicates a unique mode of germ-band development. SRXTM provides a method of non-invasive analysis that rivals the resolution achieved even by destructive methods, probing the very limits of fossilization and providing insight into embryology during the emergence of metazoan phyla.},

abstract = {Establishing the 3D architecture and morphometry of the intact pulmonary acinus is an essential step toward a more complete understanding of the relationship of lung structure and function. We combined a special fixation method with a unique volumetric nondestructive imaging technique and image processing tools to separate individual acini in the mouse lung. Interior scans of the parenchyma at a resolution of 2 µm enabled the reconstruction and quantitative study of whole acini by image analysis and stereologic methods, yielding data characterizing the 3D morphometry of the pulmonary acinus. The 3D reconstructions compared well with the architecture of silicon rubber casts of mouse acini. The image-based segmentation of individual acini allowed the computation of acinar volume and surface area, as well as estimation of the number of alveoli per acinus using stereologic methods. The acinar morphometry of male C57BL/6 mice age 12 wk and 91 wk was compared. Significant increases in all parameters as a function of age suggest a continuous change of the lung morphometry, with an increase in alveoli beyond what has been previously viewed as the maturation phase of the animals. Our image analysis methods open up opportunities for defining and quantitatively assessing the acinar structure in healthy and diseased lungs. The methods applied here to mice can be adjusted for the study of similarly prepared human lungs.},

abstract = {Pulmonary nodules with ground-glass opacity (GGO) are frequently observed and will be increasingly detected. GGO can be observed in both benign and malignant conditions, including lung cancer and its preinvasive lesions. Atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma in situ are typically manifested as pure GGOs, whereas more advanced adenocarcinomas may include a larger solid component within the GGO region. The natural history of GGOs has been gradually clarified. Approximately 20{\%} of pure GGOs and 40{\%} of part-solid GGOs gradually grow or increase their solid component, whereas others remain unchanged for years. Therefore, it remains unclear whether all pulmonary lesions with GGO should be surgically resected or whether lesions without changes may not require resection. To distinguish GGOs with growth from those without growth, a 3-year follow-up observation period is a reasonable benchmark based on the data that the volume-doubling time (VDT) of pure GGOs ranges from approximately 600 to 900 days and that of part-solid GGOs ranges from 300 to 450 days. Future studies on the genetic differences between GGOs with growth and those without growth will help establish an appropriate management algorithm.},

This is achieved by sequentially deleting points in ascending distance order until no more can be safely deleted. A point can be safely deleted only if doing so preserves topology. Distance information is provided by the chamfer distance transform, an integer approximation to the Euclidean distance transform. Two variations of DOHT are presented that arise from using different rules for preserving points. The first uses explicit rules for preserving the ends of medial axes or edges of medial surfaces, and the second preserves the centers of maximal balls identified from the chamfer distance transform. By thresholding the centers according to their distance values, the user can control the scale of features represented in the skeleton. Results are presented for real and synthetic 2D and 3D data.},

abstract = {Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a key role in developmental biology and in maintenance of the steady state in continuously renewing tissues. Currently, its existence is inferred mainly from gel electrophoresis of a pooled DNA extract as PCD was shown to be associated with DNA fragmentation. Based on this observation, we describe here the development of a method for the in situ visualization of PCD at the single-cell level, while preserving tissue architecture. Conventional histological sections, pretreated with protease, were nick end labeled with biotinylated poly dU, introduced by terminal deoxy-transferase, and then stained using avidin-conjugated peroxidase. The reaction is specific, only nuclei located at positions where PCD is expected are stained. The initial screening includes: small and large intestine, epidermis, lymphoid tissues, ovary, and other organs. A detailed analysis revealed that the process is initiated at the nuclear periphery, it is relatively short (1-3 h from initiation to cell elimination) and that PCD appears in tissues in clusters. The extent of tissue-PCD revealed by this method is considerably greater than apoptosis detected by nuclear morphology, and thus opens the way for a variety of studies.},

abstract = {In many mammalian species, the removal of one lung [pneumonectomy (PNX)] is associated with the compensatory growth of the remaining lung. To investigate the hypothesis that parenchymal deformation may trigger lung regeneration, we used respiratory-gated micro-computed tomography scanning to create three-dimensional finite-element geometric models of the murine cardiac lobe with cyclic breathing. Models were constructed of respiratory-gated micro-computed tomography scans pre-PNX and 24 h post-PNX. The computational models demonstrated that the maximum stretch ratio map was patchy and heterogeneous, particularly in subpleural, juxta-diaphragmatic, and cephalad regions of the lobe. In these parenchymal regions, the material line segments at peak inspiration were frequently two- to fourfold greater after PNX; some regions of the post-PNX cardiac lobe demonstrated parenchymal compression at peak inspiration. Similarly, analyses of parenchymal maximum shear strain demonstrated heterogeneous regions of mechanical stress with focal regions demonstrating a threefold increase in shear strain after PNX.

@article{Groso2006a,
abstract = {We report the implementation of a method which can yield the 3D distribution of the phase (refractive index) of a weakly absorbing object from a single tomographic data set. In order to reduce the residual absorption artifact (due to the fact that only one data set is used) the original algorithm presented by A. V. Bronnikov is amended by adding in the filter a factor found by using a semi empirical approach. The quality of the reconstruction is largely sufficient for optimal segmentation and further postprocessing even though the filter correction is based on assumption of constant absorption. This one step approach allows keeping radiation dose to the minimum. Spatial resolution is comparable to the conventional absorption based technique. The performance of the method is validated by using an established phase contrast technique.},

abstract = {The geometry and morphometry of intraacinar airways in rat and rabbit lungs were studied from silicone rubber casts. Acini, defined as the complex of alveolated airways distal to the "terminal" bronchiole, were trimmed off the bronchial tree. In both species, the acinar volume followed a log-normal distribution over a range in size of one order of magnitude. At an inflation level of 60{\%} total lung capacity, their mean volume was 1.86 mm3 in the rat and 3.46 mm3 in the rabbit. On a representative sample of acini of different volumes, the branching pattern was characterized as irregular dichotomy, and the segment length and inner and outer diameters were measured. The average acinus had a mean of six generations in the rat and seven in the rabbit. Both showed a decrease in segment length and inner diameter with each generation. The mean longitudinal pathway length--that is, the distance from the initial acinar segment to the terminal sacs--was found to depend on the cube root of the acinar volume in both species. It was calculated at 1.46 and 1.95 mm for rat and rabbit, respectively.},

The system utilizes a large-format digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) camera to capture the image from a standard fluorescent screen.

The system has been used for initial phantom tests in urban hospitals and Himalayan clinics in Nepal, and it has been evaluated in the laboratory at the University of Arizona by additional phantom studies. Typical phantom images are presented in this paper, and a simplified discussion of the detective quantum efficiency of the detector is given.},

@article{Thurner2006,
abstract = {Synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SRmicroCT) is a very useful technique when it comes to three-dimensional (3D) imaging of complex internal and external geometries. Being a fully non-destructive technique, SRmicroCT can be combined with other experiments in situ for functional imaging. We are especially interested in the combination of SRmicroCT with mechanical testing in order to gain new insights in the failure mechanism of trabecular bone. This interest is motivated by the immense costs in health care due to patients suffering from osteoporosis, a systemic skeletal disease resulting in decreased bone stability and increased fracture risk. To better investigate the different failure mechanisms on the microlevel, we have developed a novel in situ mechanical compression device, capable of exerting both static and dynamic displacements on experimental samples. The device was calibrated for mechanical testing using solid aluminum and bovine trabecular bone samples. To study different failure mechanisms in trabecular bone, we compared a fatigued and a non-fatigued bovine bone sample with respect to failure initiation and propagation. The fatigued sample failed in a burst-like fashion in contrast to the non-fatigued sample, which exhibited a distinct localized failure band. Moreover, microscopic cracks - microcracks and microfractures - were uncovered in a 3D fashion illustrating the failure process in great detail. The majority of these cracks were connected to a bone surface. The data also showed that the classification of microcracks and -fractures from 2D section can sometimes be ambiguous, which is also true for the distinction of diffuse and distinct microdamage. Detailed investigation of the failure mechanism in these samples illustrated that trabecular bone often fails in delamination, providing a mechanism for energy dissipation while conserving trabecular bone architecture. In the future, this will allow an even better understanding of bone mechanics related to its hierarchical structural organization.},

abstract = {Eight normal human lungs, obtained from patients dying of causes not involving the lung. were totally fixed in situ by instillation of a glutaraldehyde solution into the airways shortly post mortem. The age range was 19–40 years, average body weight was 74 kg and the average lung volume 4300 ml. Stratified random samples from twelve regions were morphometrically studied by electron microscopy using stereological methods. The fine structure of the human lung parenchyma as seen by scanning and transmission electron microscopy is described. The alveolar surface area was found to be 143 m2 on the average (± 12); this value is 75{\%} higher than previous light microscopic estimates mainly because of higher resolution of the electron microscope thus leading to a different definition of ‘alveolar surface'. Capillary surface area and volume were 126 m2 (±12) and 213 ml (± 31), respectively. The arithmetic mean thickness of the human air-blood tissue barrier was estimated at 2.2 $\mu$m (±0.19) and is thus considerably thicker than that found in other mammals: the same holds for the harmonic mean thickness of the barrier (0.62 $\mu$±0.04). This appears to be related to a particularly large amount of connective tissue fibers found in the human alveolar septum. From this morphometric information total pulmonary diffusion capacity for 02 was calculated; using the set of largest and smallest physical coefficients we obtained respectively a maximal value, View the MathML source, and a minimal value, View the MathML source. These data relate to the totally inflated and unfolded lung; if they are corrected to account for ‘available' gas exchange surface, reduced because of the presence of an alveolar extracellular lining, we obtain for ‘available' diffusion capacity : View the MathML source respectively. These corrected values seem to agree with physiological estimates of human dl in exercise.},

abstract = {Meta-analytical techniques were applied to selected echocardiographic reports on athlete's heart. The combined analysis of studies in which competitive long-distance runners were compared to matched nonathletic control subjects, revealed a 10{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) higher left ventricular internal diameter in the runners, an 18{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) thicker wall and an 8{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05) greater relative wall thickness. In strength athletes these differences averaged +2.5{\%} (p {\textless} 0.01), +15{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05) and +12{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05), respectively, and in cyclists +9{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05), +29{\%} (p {\textless} 0.01) and +19{\%} (p {\textless}0.05). When compared to their respective controls, left ventricular mass was larger by 64{\%} (p {\textless} 0.01) in cyclists, 48{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001) in runners and 25{\%} (p {\textless} 0.05) in strength athletes. There were no differences in left ventricular systolic or diastolic function at rest. The meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, in which athletes were assessed in active and inactive periods, suggested that at least part of the differences from nonathletes can be ascribed to the training per se. In conclusion, the classification of left ventricular hypertrophy in athletes as eccentric or concentric has to be considered as a relative concept, most likely related to the fact that training regimens and/or sports activities are not exclusively of the dynamic or static type but comprise both components to a variable extent.},

We studied the consequences of an early postnatal and short dexamethasone treatment (0.1-0.01 microg/g, days 1-4) on lung development in rats, focusing on its influence on peaks of cell proliferation around day 4 and of programmed cell death at days 19-21. By morphological criteria, we observed a dexamethasone-induced premature maturation of the septa (day 4), followed by a transient septal immatureness and delayed alveolarization leading to complete rescue of the structural changes. The numbers of proliferating (anti-Ki67) and dying cells (TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling) were determined and compared with controls. In dexamethasone-treated animals, both the peak of cell proliferation and the peak of programmed cell death were reduced to baseline, whereas the expression of tissue transglutaminase (transglutaminase-C), another marker for postnatal lung maturation, was not significantly altered. We hypothesize that a short neonatal course of dexamethasone leads to severe but transient structural changes of the lung parenchyma and influences the balance between cell proliferation and cell death even in later stages of lung maturation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to study physico-chemical changes in irradiating aqueous sucrose solutions from the point of view of their usefulness for technological dosimetry. Non-irradiated sucrose solutions are optically "empty" in the visible and near UV range. After gamma irradiation an absorption band with a maximum at 263 nm appears. It was confirmed that this band can be used as dosimetric signal for the dose range: 1-10 kGy. The species responsible for the 263 nm band is a neutral product of sucrose oxidation by an OH radical. High energy electron irradiation creates another UV absorbing species with the absorption band peaked at 270 nm. Further investigations are necessary to establish to what extent it can be used for electron beam dosimetry.},

abstract = {Combustion-derived and synthetic nano-sized particles (NSP) have gained considerable interest among pulmonary researchers and clinicians for two main reasons. 1) Inhalation exposure to combustion-derived NSP was associated with increased pulmonary and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality as suggested by epidemiological studies. Experimental evidence has provided a mechanistic picture of the adverse health effects associated with inhalation of combustion-derived and synthetic NSP. 2) The toxicological potential of NSP contrasts with the potential application of synthetic NSP in technological as well as medicinal settings, with the latter including the use of NSP as diagnostics or therapeutics. To shed light on this paradox, this article aims to highlight recent findings about the interaction of inhaled NSP with the structures of the respiratory tract including surfactant, alveolar macrophages, and epithelial cells. Cellular responses to NSP exposure include the generation of reactive oxygen species and the induction of an inflammatory response. Furthermore, this review places special emphasis on methodological differences between experimental studies and the caveats associated with the dose metrics and points out ways to overcome inherent methodological problems.},

abstract = {Analysis of cancer and other pathological diseases, like the interstitial lung diseases (ILDs), is usually possible through Computed Tomography (CT) scans. To aid this, a preprocessing step of segmentation is performed to reduce the area to be analyzed, segmenting the lungs and removing unimportant regions. Generally, complex methods are developed to extract the lung region, also using hand-made feature extractors to enhance segmentation. With the popularity of deep learning techniques and its automated feature learning, we propose a lung segmentation approach using fully convolutional networks (FCNs) combined with fully connected conditional random fields (CRF), employed in many state-of-the-art segmentation works. Aiming to develop a generalized approach, the publicly available datasets from University Hospitals of Geneva (HUG) and VESSEL12 challenge were studied, including many healthy and pathological CT scans for evaluation. Experiments using the dataset individually, its trained model on the other dataset and a combination of both datasets were employed. Dice scores of {\$}98.67\backslash{\%}\backslashpm0.94\backslash{\%}{\$} for the HUG-ILD dataset and {\$}99.19\backslash{\%}\backslashpm0.37\backslash{\%}{\$} for the VESSEL12 dataset were achieved, outperforming works in the former and obtaining similar state-of-the-art results in the latter dataset, showing the capability in using deep learning approaches.},

abstract = {X-ray phase-contrast microtomography (XPC$\mu$T) is a label-free, high-resolution imaging modality for analyzing early development of vertebrate embryos in vivo by using time-lapse sequences of 3D volumes. Here we provide a detailed protocol for applying this technique to study gastrulation in Xenopus laevis (African clawed frog) embryos. In contrast to $\mu$MRI, XPC$\mu$T images optically opaque embryos with subminute temporal and micrometer-range spatial resolution. We describe sample preparation, culture and suspension of embryos, tomographic imaging with a typical duration of 2 h (gastrulation and neurulation stages), intricacies of image pre-processing, phase retrieval, tomographic reconstruction, segmentation and motion analysis. Moreover, we briefly discuss our present understanding of X-ray dose effects (heat load and radiolysis), and we outline how to optimize the experimental configuration with respect to X-ray energy, photon flux density, sample-detector distance, exposure time per tomographic projection, numbers of projections and time-lapse intervals. The protocol requires an interdisciplinary effort of developmental biologists for sample preparation and data interpretation, X-ray physicists for planning and performing the experiment and applied mathematicians/computer scientists/physicists for data processing and analysis. Sample preparation requires 9-48 h, depending on the stage of development to be studied. Data acquisition takes 2-3 h per tomographic time-lapse sequence. Data processing and analysis requires a further 2 weeks, depending on the availability of computing power and the amount of detail required to address a given scientific problem.},

abstract = {The major function of the lung is gas exchange and depends on alveolar and capillary parameters such as surface area and volume. The number of alveoli may report on the nature of structural changes in lung parenchyma during development, illness or changing environmental factors. We therefore developed an efficient and easily applicable stereological design for estimating and monitoring these structural parameters in the mouse lung. The estimation of volume fractions of different lung compartments has been carried out by point counting. A combination of cycloid grids superimposed on vertical sections was used to estimate the capillary surface area with isotropic test lines. Capillary length could be measured using the harmonic mean of the surface weighted diameter. The Euler characteristic applied in the physical fractionator with varying but known sampling fractions (Horovitz-Thompson estimator) enabled us to estimate alveolar number. In adult mice lungs, we obtained total values for alveolar number of 2.31 x 10(6) alveoli in a pair of lungs, alveolar surface area of 82.2 cm(2), capillary surface area of 124 cm(2), and capillary length of 1.13 km.

abstract = {New morphometric procedures allow selection of alveoli for analysis in an unbiased manner and then to determine the volume of individual alveoli. The latter, together with the easily measured lung volume, allows the calculation of alveolar number. These new techniques have greatly increased the rigor of the study of the formation of alveoli and the manner in which this process is regulated. This review deals mainly with work based on these new morphometric methods that explore the regulation of the formation of alveoli and hence the size of the lung's gas-exchange surface area. We expect that continued application of these methods, buttressed with experiments at the cellular and molecular level, will result in a fundamental understanding of how the formation of alveoli and the size of the gas-exchange surface area is regulated. This new information holds the promise of translation into the induction of the formation of alveoli for therapeutic purposes.},

abstract = {Dry snow slab avalanche release is preceded by two fracture mechanical processes: shear failure of a weak layer or an interface within the snowpack, followed by tensile failure of the overlaying slab. For a slope stability analysis based on fracture mechanics, the fracture toughness of snow has to be known. The purpose of this work was to evaluate snow fracture toughness in mode 1, to determine to what extent it is affected by the specimen size and shape and to search for adequate correction methods. Edge-cracked beam-shaped snow specimens cut from homogeneous layers of naturally deposited snow were subjected to three-point bending and cantilever beam tests. To describe the size dependence an empirical size effect law and the FAD (failure assessment diagram) approach were explored. By comparing the three-point bending with the cantilever beam tests a shape dependence of the toughness was found. The fracture process zone was estimated to be in the order of at least one centimetre. Due to the large size of the fracture process zone a dependence of the toughness on the specimen size has to be expected, as it is typical for non-linear, quasi-brittle materials. Experiments with four different specimen sizes clearly confirmed that toughness is size dependent, possibly up to the scale of a slab avalanche. Preliminary results suggest that the actual fracture toughness might be twice as large as the one determined experimentally. Therefore, size correction functions will be essential to transform toughness data of laboratory-scaled experiments to the scale relevant for snow slope stability models. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Imaging the human brain in three dimensions has always been a challenge on the cell level. In vivo methods lack spatial resolution, and optical microscopy has a limited penetration depth. Herein, we show that hard X-ray phase tomography can visualise a volume of up to 43 mm(3) of human post mortem or biopsy brain samples, by demonstrating the method on the cerebellum. We automatically identified 5,000 Purkinje cells with an error of less than 5{\%} at their layer and determined the local surface density to 165 cells per mm(2) on average. Moreover, we highlight that three-dimensional data allows for the segmentation of sub-cellular structures, including dendritic tree and Purkinje cell nucleoli, without dedicated staining. The method suggests that automatic cell feature quantification of human tissues is feasible in phase tomograms obtained with isotropic resolution in a label-free manner.},

During early fetal development, the airways act as a template for pulmonary blood vessel development in that the vessels form by vasculogenesis around the branching airways. In later lung development, as the alveoli multiply, new capillaries form by angiogenesis. As blood vessels increase in size, they develop a muscle wall that is relatively thick during fetal life and shows a rapid reduction after birth. The control of development by growth factors and the physiological changes immediately after birth are described in this review. Abnormal pulmonary vascular development leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension and strategies for treatment are also discussed.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional printing allows for the production of highly detailed objects through a process known as additive manufacturing. Traditional, mold-injection methods to create models or parts have several limitations, the most important of which is a difficulty in making highly complex products in a timely, cost-effective manner.(1) However, gradual improvements in three-dimensional printing technology have resulted in both high-end and economy instruments that are now available for the facile production of customized models.(2) These printers have the ability to extrude high-resolution objects with enough detail to accurately represent in vivo images generated from a preclinical X-ray CT scanner. With proper data collection, surface rendering, and stereolithographic editing, it is now possible and inexpensive to rapidly produce detailed skeletal and soft tissue structures from X-ray CT data. Even in the early stages of development, the anatomical models produced by three-dimensional printing appeal to both educators and researchers who can utilize the technology to improve visualization proficiency. (3, 4) The real benefits of this method result from the tangible experience a researcher can have with data that cannot be adequately conveyed through a computer screen. The translation of pre-clinical 3D data to a physical object that is an exact copy of the test subject is a powerful tool for visualization and communication, especially for relating imaging research to students, or those in other fields. Here, we provide a detailed method for printing plastic models of bone and organ structures derived from X-ray CT scans utilizing an Albira X-ray CT system in conjunction with PMOD, ImageJ, Meshlab, Netfabb, and ReplicatorG software packages.},

It has the capability to address the role of trabecular architecture on the mechanical properties of bone and to study trabecular bone remodeling. The system described in this work is based on a compact fan-beam type tomograph that can work in spiral scanning or multislice mode. An X-ray tube with a microfocus is used as a source, a CCD-array as a detector. Samples with diameters from a few millimeters to a maximum of 14 mm can be measured, typically, bone biopsies with a diameter of 8 mm and a length of approximately 10 mm are measured. Spatial resolution is 28 microns. Usually the volume of interest contains 4 x 4 x 4 mm3 and is represented in 14 x 14 x 14 microns3 voxels. 3D stereological indices are extracted according to the standard definitions used in histomorphometry. Triangular surface representation is effected with an extended marching cube algorithm and forms a convenient basis for finite element analysis. Microtomographic measurements may be employed to "calibrate" lower-dose, lower-resolution images in vivo as well as to nondestructively assess unprocessed surgical bone biopsy specimens. These specimens remain intact for mechanical or histological testing.},

abstract = {There is a wide range of diseases and normal physiological processes that are associated with alterations of the vascular system in organs. Ex vivo imaging of large vascular networks became feasible with recent developments in microcomputed tomography (microCT). Current methods permit to visualize only limited numbers of physically excised regions of interests (ROIs) from larger samples. We developed a method based on modified vascular corrosion casting (VCC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and desktop and synchrotron radiation microCT (SRmicroCT) technologies to image vasculature at increasing levels of resolution, also referred to as hierarchical imaging. This novel approach allows nondestructive 3D visualization and quantification of large microvascular networks, while retaining a precise anatomical context for ROIs scanned at very high resolution. Scans of entire mouse brain VCCs were performed at 16-microm resolution with a desktop microCT system. Custom-made navigation software with a ROI selection tool enabled the identification of anatomical brain structures and precise placement of multiple ROIs. These were then scanned at 1.4-microm voxel size using SRmicroCT and a local tomography setup. A framework was developed for fast sample positioning, precise selection of ROIs, and sequential high-throughput scanning of a large numbers of brain VCCs. Despite the use of local tomography, exceptional image quality was achieved with SRmicroCT. This method enables qualitative and quantitative assessment of vasculature at unprecedented resolution and volume with relatively high throughput, opening new possibilities to study vessel architecture and vascular alterations in models of disease.},

abstract = {Although humans have been exposed to airborne nanosized particles (NSPs; {\textless} 100 nm) throughout their evolutionary stages, such exposure has increased dramatically over the last century due to anthropogenic sources. The rapidly developing field of nanotechnology is likely to become yet another source through inhalation, ingestion, skin uptake, and injection of engineered nanomaterials. Information about safety and potential hazards is urgently needed. Results of older bio-kinetic studies with NSPs and newer epidemiologic and toxicologic studies with airborne ultrafine particles can be viewed as the basis for the expanding field of nanotoxicology, which can be defined as safety evaluation of engineered nanostructures and nanodevices. Collectively, some emerging concepts of nanotoxicology can be identified from the results of these studies. When inhaled, specific sizes of NSPs are efficiently deposited by diffusional mechanisms in all regions of the respiratory tract. The small size facilitates uptake into cells and transcytosis across epithelial and endothelial cells into the blood and lymph circulation to reach potentially sensitive target sites such as bone marrow, lymph nodes, spleen, and heart. Access to the central nervous system and ganglia via translocation along axons and dendrites of neurons has also been observed. NSPs penetrating the skin distribute via uptake into lymphatic channels. Endocytosis and biokinetics are largely dependent on NSP surface chemistry (coating) and in vivo surface modifications. The greater surface area per mass compared with larger-sized particles of the same chemistry renders NSPs more active biologically. This activity includes a potential for inflammatory and pro-oxidant, but also antioxidant, activity, which can explain early findings showing mixed results in terms of toxicity of NSPs to environmentally relevant species. Evidence of mitochondrial distribution and oxidative stress response after NSP endocytosis points to a need for basic research on their interactions with subcellular structures. Additional considerations for assessing safety of engineered NSPs include careful selections of appropriate and relevant doses/concentrations, the likelihood of increased effects in a compromised organism, and also the benefits of possible desirable effects. An interdisciplinary team approach (e.g., toxicology, materials science, medicine, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, to name a few) is mandatory for nanotoxicology research to arrive at an appropriate risk assessment.},

abstract = {During respiration, particles suspended in the air are inhaled and unless cleared by airway defences they can remain and affect lung health. Their size precludes the use of standard imaging modalities so we have developed synchrotron phase-contrast X-ray imaging (PCXI) methods to non-invasively monitor the behaviour of individual particles in live mouse airways. In this study we used these techniques to examine post-deposition particle behaviour in the trachea. PCXI was used to monitor the deposition and subsequent behaviour of particles of quarry dust and lead ore; fibres of asbestos and fibreglass; and hollow glass micro-spheres. Visibility was examined in vitro and ex vivo to avoid the complicating effects of surrounding tissue and respiratory or cardiac motion. Particle behaviour was then examined after deposition onto the tracheal airway surfaces of live mice. Each particle and fibre looked and behaved differently on the airway surface. Particles lodged on the airway shortly after deposition, and the rate at which this occurred was dependent on the particle type and size. After the live-imaging experiments, excised airway samples were examined using light and electron microscopy. Evidence of particle capture into the airway surface fluids and the epithelial cell layer was found. PCXI is a valuable tool for examining post-deposition particulate behaviour in the tracheal airway. These first indications that the interaction between airways and individual particles may depend on the particle type and size should provide a novel approach to studying the early effects of respired particles on airway health.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The magnitude of the link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer may vary by histological type. METHODS We used polytomous logistic regression to evaluate whether aspects of smoking have different effects across four histological types in the Nurses' Health Study. RESULTS From 1976 to 2002, we identified 1062 cases of lung cancer: squamous cell (n = 201), small cell (n = 236), adenocarcinoma (n = 543) and large cell carcinoma (n = 82), among 65 560 current or former smokers. Risk reduction after quitting ranged from an 8{\%} reduction (relative risk (RR): 0.92, 95{\%} CI 0.91 to 0.94) to a 17{\%} reduction (RR: 0.83, 95{\%} CI 0.80 to 0.86) per year for adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma, respectively, with a 9{\%} reduction observed for large cell carcinoma and an 11{\%} reduction observed for squamous cell carcinoma. The association of age at smoking initiation and former cigarette smoking was similar across types, while the association of smoking duration differed. The risk of adenocarcinoma increased by 6{\%} per year of smoking, compared to 7{\%} for large cell, 10{\%} for squamous cell and 12{\%} for small cell. The 6{\%} difference between adenocarcinoma and small cell carcinoma is equivalent to a 3.2 to 9.7-fold increase in risk for 20 years of smoking. CONCLUSIONS The effects of the number of cigarettes smoked per day and years since quitting smoking are different across the major types of lung cancer, which are fully appreciated at long durations of smoking and smoking cessation. Smoking prevention and cessation should continue to be the focus of public health efforts to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality.},

abstract = {Understanding the formation of materials at elevated temperatures is critical for determining their final properties. Synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy is an ideal technique for studying such processes because high spatial and temporal resolutions are easily achieved and the technique is non-destructive, meaning additional analyses can take place after data collection. To exploit the state-of-the-art capabilities at the tomographic microscopy and coherent radiology experiments (TOMCAT) beamline of the Swiss Light Source, a general-use moderate-to-high-temperature furnace has been developed. Powered by two diode lasers, it provides controlled localized heating, from 673 to 1973 K, to examine many materials systems and their dynamics in real time. The system can also be operated in various thermal modalities. For example, near-isothermal conditions at a given sample location can be achieved with a prescribed time-dependent temperature. This mode is typically used to study isothermal phase transformations; for example, the formation of equiaxed grains in metallic systems or to nucleate and grow bubble foams in silicate melts under conditions that simulate volcanic processes. In another mode, the power of the laser can be fixed and the specimen moved at a constant speed in a user-defined thermal gradient. This is similar to Bridgman solidification, where the thermal gradient and cooling rate control the microstructure formation. This paper details the experimental set-up and provides multiple proofs-of-concept that illustrate the versatility of using this laser-based heating system to explore, in situ, many elevated-temperature phenomena in a variety of materials.},

Quantitative structure-function correlations can be established by morphometry. A very large surface of air-blood contact, together with a very thin tissue barrier, are required to permit adequate oxygen uptake under work conditions. However, these design features also pose problems, such as how to ventilate and perfuse this large surface evenly and efficiently, or how to ensure mechanical stability against surface forces with a minimum of supporting tissue. The discussion focuses on the extent to which novel design principles are used to overcome such problems by designing the airways as a fractal tree and the fibre support system as a tensegrity structure.},

The analysis of patient data acquired by current image modalities, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance tomography (MRT), positron emission tomography (PET), or ultrasound (US), offers previously unattained opportunities for diagnosis, therapy planning, and therapy assessment. Medical image processing is essential to leverage this increasing amount of data and to explore and present the contained information in a way suitable for the specific medical task. In this tutorial, we will approach the analysis and visualization of medical image data in an explorative manner. In particular, we will visually construct the image processing algorithms using the popular graphical data-flow builder MeVisLab, which is available as a free download for noncommercial research. We felt that it could be more interesting for the reader to see and explore examples of medical image processing that go beyond simple image enhancements. The part of exploration, to inspect medical image data and experiment with image-processing pipelines, requires software that encourages this kind of visual exploration.},

abstract = {Over the last decade assessment of angiogenesis has emerged as a potentially useful biological prognostic and predictive factor in human solid tumours. With the development of highly specific endothelial markers that can be assessed in histological archival specimens, several quantitative studies have been performed in various solid tumours. The majority of published studies have shown a positive correlation between intra-tumoural microvessel density, a measure of tumour angiogenesis, and prognosis in solid tumours. A minority of studies have not demonstrated an association and this may be attributed to significant differences in the methodologies employed for sample selection, immunostaining techniques, vessel counting and statistical analysis, although a number of biological differences may account for the discrepancy. In this review we evaluate the quantification of angiogenesis by immunohistochemistry, the relationship between tumour vascularity and metastasis, and the clinicopathological studies correlating intra-tumoral microvessel density with prognosis and response to anti-cancer therapy. In view of the extensive nature of this retrospective body of data, comparative studies are needed to identify the optimum technique and endothelial antigens (activated or pan-endothelial antigens) but subsequently prospective studies that allocate treatment on the basis of microvessel density are required.},

abstract = {To work out which microvascular remodeling processes occur in murine skeletal muscle during endurance exercise, we subjected C57BL/6 mice to voluntary running wheel training for 1 week (1 wk-t) or 6 weeks (6 wks-t). By means of morphometry, the capillarity as well as the compartmental and sub-compartmental structure of the capillaries were quantitatively described at the light microscopy level and at the electron microscopy level, respectively, in the plantaris (PLNT) muscle of the exercising mice in comparison to untrained littermates. In the early phase of the training (1 wk-t), angiogenesis [32{\%} higher capillary/fiber (C/F) ratio; P{\textless}0.05] in PLNT muscle was accompanied by a tendency for capillary lumen enlargement (30{\%}; P=0.06) and a reduction of the pericapillary basement membrane thickness [(CBMT) 12.7{\%}; P=0.09] as well as a 21{\%} shortening of intraluminal protrusion length (P{\textless}0.05), all compared with controls. After long-term training (6 wks-t), when the mice reached a steady state in running activity, additional angiogenesis (C/F ratio: 76{\%}; P{\textless}0.05) and a 16.3{\%} increase in capillary tortuosity (P{\textless}0.05) were established, accompanied by reversal of the lumen expansion (23{\%}; P{\textgreater}0.05), further reduction of the CBMT (16.5{\%}; P{\textless}0.05) and additional shortening of the intraluminal protrusion length (23{\%}; P{\textless}0.05), all compared with controls. Other structural indicators, such as capillary profile sizes, profile area densities, perimeters of the capillary compartments and concentrations of endothelium-pericyte peg-socket junctions, were not significantly different between the mouse groups. Besides angiogenesis, increase of capillary tortuosity and reduction of CBMT represent the most striking microvascular remodeling processes in skeletal muscle of mice that undergo running wheel training.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in imaging techniques as non-invasive means of quantitatively measuring regional lung structure and function. Abnormalities in lung ventilation due to alterations in airway function such as those observed in asthma and COPD are highly heterogeneous, and experimental methods to study this heterogeneity are crucial for better understanding of disease mechanisms and drug targeting strategies. In severe obstructive diseases requiring mechanical ventilation, the optimal ventilatory strategy to achieve recruitment of poorly ventilated lung zones remains a matter of considerable debate. We have used synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SRCT) for the in vivo study of regional lung ventilation and airway function. This imaging technique allows direct quantification of stable Xenon (Xe) gas used as an inhaled contrast agent using K-edge subtraction imaging. Dynamics of Xe wash-in can be used to calculate quantitative maps of regional specific lung ventilation. More recently, the development of Spiral-CT has allowed the acquisition of 3D images of the pulmonary bronchial tree and airspaces. This technique gives access to quantitative measurements of regional lung volume, ventilation, and mechanical properties. Examples of application in an experimental model of allergic asthma and in imaging lung recruitment as a function of mechanical ventilation parameters will be presented. The future orientations of this technique will be discussed.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) applications continue to expand, and they require faster data acquisition speeds and improved spatial resolution. Achieving isotropic resolution, by means of cubic voxels, in combination with longitudinal coverage beyond 20 mm would represent a substantial advance in clinical CT because few commercially available scanners are capable of this at present. To achieve this goal, a prototype CT system incorporating a movable array of 20 cm X 20 cm, 200-microm-pitch amorphous silicon flat-panel x-ray detectors and a conventional CT x-ray source was constructed at the General Electric Global Research Center and performance tested at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The device was designed for preclinical imaging applications and has a scan field of 13 to 33 cm, with a magnification of 1.5. Image quality performance measurements, such as spatial and contrast resolutions, were obtained using both industry standard and custom phantoms. Spatial resolution, quantified by the system's modulation transfer function, indicated improvement by a factor of 2.5 to 5 in isotropic spatial resolution over current commercially available systems, with 10{\%} modulation transfer function modulations at frequencies from 19 to 31 lp/cm. Low-contrast detectability results were obtained from industry-standard phantoms and were comprised of embedded contrast regions of 0.3{\%}, 0.5{\%}, and 1.0{\%} over areas of several mm2. Performance was sufficient to easily distinguish 1.0{\%} contrast regions down to 2 mm in diameter relative to the background. On the basis of scans of specialized hydroxyapatite phantoms, the system response is extremely linear (R2=0.990) in bone-equivalent density regimens. Standard CT dose index CTDI100 and CTDIw measurements were also conducted to assess dose delivery using a 16-cm-CTDI phantom and a 120 kV 120 mAs scan technique. The CTDIw ranged from 30 mGy (one-panel mode) to 113 mGy (two-panel mode) for this system. Lastly, several in vivo canine and murine samples were examined, and preliminary results from these scans are presented. On the basis of our results, it is clear that flat-panel-based CT scanners are useful for high-contrast high-resolution clinical applications, providing up to a 20-fold increase in volumetric resolution over most commercially available scanners.},

abstract = {The pulmonary airways are subdivided into conducting and gas-exchanging airways. The small tree of gas-exchanging airways which is fed by the most distal conducting airway represents an acinus. Very little is known about the development of the number of acini. The goal of this study was to estimate their number throughout rat postnatal development. Right middle rat lung lobes were obtained at postnatal day 4–60, stained with heavy metals, paraffin embedded, and scanned by synchrotron radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy or imaged with micro computed tomography after critical point drying. The acini were counted by detection of the transitional bronchioles [bronchioalveolar duct junction (BADJ)] by using morphological criteria (thickness of the walls of airways and appearance of alveoli) during examination of the resulting three-dimensional (3D) image stacks. Between postnatal days 4–60, the number of acini per lung remained constant (5,840 ± 547 acini), but their volume increased significantly. We concluded that the acini are formed before the end of the saccular stage (before postnatal day 4) and that the developmental increase of the lung volume is achieved by an increase of the acinar volume and not by an increase of their number. Furthermore, our results propose that the bronchioalveolar stem cells, which are residing in the BADJ, are as constant in their location as the BADJ itself.},

However, manual analysis of 3-D lung CT images is tedious, time consuming and, thus, impractical for routine clinical care. We have previously reported an automated rule-based method for extraction of airway trees from 3-D CT images using a priori knowledge about airway-tree anatomy. Although the method's sensitivity was quite good, its specificity suffered from a large number of falsely detected airways. We present a new approach to airway-tree detection based on fuzzy logic that increases the method's specificity without compromising its sensitivity. The method was validated in 32 CT image slices randomly selected from five volumetric canine electron-beam CT data sets. The fuzzy-logic method significantly outperformed the previously reported rule-based method (p {\textless} 0.002).},

@article{Bouchet2010,
abstract = {PURPOSE Synchrotron microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) relies on spatial fractionation of the incident photon beam into parallel micron-wide beams. Our aim was to analyze the effects of MRT on normal brain and 9L gliosarcoma tissues, particularly on blood vessels. METHODS AND MATERIALS Responses to MRT (two arrays, one lateral, one anteroposterior (2 × 400 Gy), intersecting orthogonally in the tumor region) were studied during 6 weeks using MRI, immunohistochemistry, and vascular endothelial growth factor Western blot. RESULTS MRT increased the median survival time of irradiated rats (×3.25), significantly increased blood vessel permeability, and inhibited tumor growth; a cytotoxic effect on 9L cells was detected 5 days after irradiation. Significant decreases in tumoral blood volume fraction and vessel diameter were measured from 8 days after irradiation, due to loss of endothelial cells in tumors as detected by immunochemistry. Edema was observed in the normal brain exposed to both crossfired arrays about 6 weeks after irradiation. This edema was associated with changes in blood vessel morphology and an overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor. Conversely, vascular parameters and vessel morphology in brain regions exposed to one of the two arrays were not damaged, and there was no loss of vascular endothelia. CONCLUSIONS We show for the first time that preferential damage of MRT to tumor vessels versus preservation of radioresistant normal brain vessels contributes to the efficient palliation of 9L gliosarcomas in rats. Molecular pathways of repair mechanisms in normal and tumoral vascular networks after MRT may be essential for the improvement of such differential effects on the vasculature.},

abstract = {The growth of solid tumours necessitates angiogenesis. The aim of this paper is the presentation and evaluation of different ex vivo methods for analysing tumour angiogenesis. Oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) were induced in mice by subcutaneous injection of tumour cells in the groin region and processed for histology and microvascular corrosion casting. Vascularization was analysed light microscopically using CD31 immunochemistry. Corrosion casts were analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) and synchrotron radiation-based micro computed tomography (SR$\mu$CT). Immunochemistry allows for a simple and authentic detection and stereological quantification of the SCC vascularization. $\mu$CT imaging of the corrosion casts gives a high-quality overview over the three-dimensional (3D) microvascular architecture. SEM and SR$\mu$CT allow a high-definition display of the vessel morphology, providing magnificent detail recognition down to the capillary level enabling imaging of different forms of tumour angiogenesis, e.g., sprouting and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Immunochemistry and SEM are regarded as suitable for most of the morphometrical and morphological assessments because of the simple procedure and the high explanatory power, especially in combination with each other. High resolution SR$\mu$CT helps answering specialized questions, however, requires sophisticated data processing for visualization and is of limited availability. {\textcopyright} 2014 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

@article{Vasilescu2013,
abstract = {Quantitative assessment of the lung microstructure using standard stereological methods such as volume fractions of tissue, alveolar surface area, or number of alveoli, are essential for understanding the state of normal and diseased lung. These measures are traditionally obtained from histological sections of the lung tissue, a process that ultimately destroys the three-dimensional (3-D) anatomy of the tissue. In comparison, a novel X-ray-based imaging method that allows nondestructive sectioning and imaging of fixed lungs at multiple resolutions can overcome this limitation. Scanning of the whole lung at high resolution and subsequent regional sampling at ultrahigh resolution without physically dissecting the organ allows the application of design-based stereology for assessment of the whole lung structure. Here we validate multiple stereological estimates performed on micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) images by comparing them with those obtained via conventional histology on the same mouse lungs. We explore and discuss the potentials and limitations of the two approaches. Histological examination offers higher resolution and the qualitative differentiation of tissues by staining, but ultimately loses 3-D tissue relationships, whereas $\mu$CT allows for the integration of morphometric data with the spatial complexity of lung structure. However, $\mu$CT has limited resolution satisfactory for the sterological estimates presented in this study but not for differentiation of tissues. We conclude that introducing stereological methods in $\mu$CT studies adds value by providing quantitative information on internal structures while not curtailing more complex approaches to the study of lung architecture in the context of physiological or pathological studies.},

@article{Schittny2017,
abstract = {To fulfill the task of gas-exchange the lung possesses a huge inner surface and a tree-like system of conducting airways ventilating the gas-exchange area. During lung development the conducting airways are formed first, followed by the formation and enlargement of the gas-exchange area. The latter (alveolarization) continues until young adulthood. During organogenesis the left and right lungs have their own anlage, an outpouching of the foregut. Each lung bud starts a repetitive process of outgrowth and branching (branching morphogenesis) which forms all of the future airways mainly during pseudoglandular stage. During the canalicular stage the differentiation of the epithelia becomes visible and the bronchioalveolar duct junction is formed. The location of this junction stays constant throughout live. Towards the end of the canalicular stage first gas-exchange may take place and a survival of prematurely born babies is possible. 90{\%} of the gas-exchange surface area will be formed by alveolarization; a process where existing airspaces are subdivided by the formation of new walls (septa). This process requires a double layered capillary network at the basis of the newly forming septum. However, in parallel to alveolarization the double- layered capillary network of the immature septa fuses to a single layered network resulting in an optimized setup for gas-exchange. Alveolarization still continues, because at sites where new septa are lifting off of preexisting mature septa the required second capillary layer will be formed instantly by angiogenesis. The latter warrens a lifelong ability of alveolarization, which is important for any kind of lung regeneration.},

abstract = {A source of x-rays capable of exciting the characteristic emission lines of Mo and Ag is demonstrated. The device, which requires no external high voltage supply, uses the triboelectric effect to produce a charge imbalance when silicone and a metal-loaded epoxy are made to repeatedly contact each other in vacuum. This provides a source of 40 keV electrons which generate bremsstrahlung and characteristic x-rays at a rate of {\textgreater} 10 5 per contact cycle. By increasing the repetition rate of the contact cycle the viability of a device that emits 10 8   x-ray photons per second is suggested, making triboelectricity an inexpensive source of x-rays. The form factors and simplicity of such devices open up interesting possibilities for x-ray imaging.},

abstract = {In-situ synchrotron X-ray computed microtomography with sub-micrometer voxel size was used to study the decomposition of gas hydrates in a sedimentary matrix. Xenon-hydrate was used instead of methane hydrate to enhance the absorption contrast. The microstructural features of the decomposition process were elucidated indicating that the decomposition starts at the hydrate-gas interface; it does not proceed at the contacts with quartz grains. Melt water accumulates at retreating hydrate surface. The decomposition is not homogeneous and the decomposition rates depend on the distance of the hydrate surface to the gas phase indicating a diffusion-limitation of the gas transport through the water phase. Gas is found to be metastably enriched in the water phase with a concentration decreasing away from the hydrate-water interface. The initial decomposition process facilitates redistribution of fluid phases in the pore space and local reformation of gas hydrates. The observations allow also rationalizing earlier conjectures from experiments with low spatial resolutions and suggest that the hydrate-sediment assemblies remain intact until the hydrate spacers between sediment grains finally collapse; possible effects on mechanical stability and permeability are discussed. The resulting time resolved characteristics of gas hydrate decomposition and the influence of melt water on the reaction rate are of importance for a suggested gas recovery from marine sediments by depressurization.},

abstract = {The formation process of gas hydrates in sedimentary matrices is of crucial importance for the physical and transport properties of the resulting aggregates. This process has never been observed in situ at submicron resolution. Here we report on synchrotron-based microtomographic studies by which the nucleation and growth processes of gas hydrate were observed at 276 K in various sedimentary matrices such as natural quartz (with and without admixtures of montmorillonite type clay) or glass beads with differ- ent surface properties, at varying water saturation. Both juvenile water and metastably gas-enriched water obtained from gas hydrate decomposition was used. Xenon gas was employed to enhance the density con- trast between gas hydrate and the fluid phases involved. The nucleation sites can be easily identified and the various growth patterns are clearly established. In sediments under-saturated with juvenile water, nucle- ation starts at the water-gas interface resulting in an initially several micrometer thick gas hydrate film; fur- ther growth proceeds to form isometric single crystals of 10–20 mm size. The growth of gas hydrate from gas-enriched water follows a different pattern, via the nucleation in the bulk of liquid producing polyhedral single crystals. A striking feature in both cases is the systematic appearance of a fluid phase film of up to several micron thickness between gas hydrates and the surface of the quartz grains. These microstructural findings are relevant for future efforts of quantitative rock physics modeling of gas hydrates in sedimentary matrices and explain the anomalous attenuation of seismic/sonic waves.},

abstract = {Rapid progress in exploring the human and mouse genome has resulted in the generation of a multitude of mouse models to study gene functions in their biological context. However, effective screening methods that allow rapid noninvasive phenotyping of transgenic and knockout mice are still lacking. To identify murine models with bone alterations in vivo, we used flat-panel volume computed tomography (fpVCT) for high-resolution 3-D imaging and developed an algorithm with a computational intelligence system. First, we tested the accuracy and reliability of this approach by imaging discoidin domain receptor 2- (DDR2-) deficient mice, which display distinct skull abnormalities as shown by comparative landmark-based analysis. High-contrast fpVCT data of the skull with 200 microm isotropic resolution and 8-s scan time allowed segmentation and computation of significant shape features as well as visualization of morphological differences. The application of a trained artificial neuronal network to these datasets permitted a semi-automatic and highly accurate phenotype classification of DDR2-deficient compared to C57BL/6 wild-type mice. Even heterozygous DDR2 mice with only subtle phenotypic alterations were correctly determined by fpVCT imaging and identified as a new class. In addition, we successfully applied the algorithm to classify knockout mice lacking the DDR1 gene with no apparent skull deformities. Thus, this new method seems to be a potential tool to identify novel mouse phenotypes with skull changes from transgenic and knockout mice on the basis of random mutagenesis as well as from genetic models. However for this purpose, new neuronal networks have to be created and trained. In summary, the combination of fpVCT images with artificial neuronal networks provides a reliable, novel method for rapid, cost-effective, and noninvasive primary screening tool to detect skeletal phenotypes in mice.},

An inverse dose-response relation between alcohol intake and gastric emptying was evident. Appetite was similar with consumption of wine or tea (difference 0.11, −0.12 to 0.34; P=0.35), but reduced if both wine and schnapps were consumed (difference −0.40, −0.01 to −0.79; P{\textless}0.046). No difference in dyspeptic symptoms was present.Conclusions Gastric emptying after a Swiss cheese fondue is noticeably slower and appetite suppressed if consumed with higher doses of alcohol. This effect was not associated with dyspeptic symptoms.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00943696.},

abstract = {In an effort to understand the fate of inhaled submicron particles in the small sacs, or alveoli, comprising the gas-exchange region of the lung, we calculated the flow in three-dimensional (3D) rhythmically expanding models of alveolated ducts. Since convection toward the alveolar walls is a precursor to particle deposition, it was the goal of this paper to investigate the streamline maps' dependence upon alveoli location along the acinar tree. On the alveolar midplane, the recirculating flow pattern exhibited closed streamlines with a stagnation saddle point. Off the midplane we found no closed streamlines but nested, funnel-like, spiral, structures (reminiscent of Russian nesting dolls) that were directed towards the expanding walls in inspiration, and away from the contracting walls in expiration. These nested, funnel-like, structures were surrounded by air that flowed into the cavity from the central channel over inspiration and flowed from the cavity to the central channel over expiration. We also found that fluid particle tracks exhibited similar nested funnel-like spiral structures. We conclude that these unique alveolar flow structures may be of importance in enhancing deposition. In addition, due to inertia, the nested, funnel-like, structures change shape and position slightly during a breathing cycle, resulting in flow mixing. Also, each inspiration feeds a fresh supply of particle-laden air from the central channel to the region surrounding the mixing region. Thus, this combination of flow mixer and flow feeder makes each individual alveolus an effective mixing unit, which is likely to play an important role in determining the overall efficiency of convective mixing in the acinus.},

abstract = {Lung stereology has a long and successful tradition. From mice to men, the application of new stereological methods at several levels (alveoli, parenchymal cells, organelles, proteins) has led to new insights into normal lung architecture, parenchymal remodelling in emphysema-like pathology, alveolar type II cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy and intracellular surfactant alterations as well as distribution of surfactant proteins. The Euler number of the network of alveolar openings, estimated using physical disectors at the light microscopic level, is an unbiased and direct estimate of alveolar number. Surfactant-producing alveolar type II cells can be counted and sampled for local size estimation with physical disectors at a high magnification light microscopic level. The number of their surfactant storage organelles, lamellar bodies, can be estimated using physical disectors at the EM level. By immunoelectron microscopy, surfactant protein distribution can be analysed with the relative labelling index. Together with the well-established classical stereological methods, these design-based methods now allow for a complete quantitative phenotype analysis in lung development and disease, including the structural characterization of gene-manipulated mice, at the light and electron microscopic level.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 American Association for Cancer Research. Accurate stratification of tumors is imperative for adequate cancer management. In addition to staging, morphologic sub-typing allows stratification of patients into additional prognostic groups. In this study, we used an image-based computational method on pan-cytokeratin IHC stainings to quantify tumor fragmentation (TF), a measure of tumor invasiveness of lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). In two independent clinical cohorts from tissue microarrays (TMA: n = 208 patients) and whole sections (WS: n = 99 patients), TF was associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of blood vessel infiltration. A third cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA: n = 335 patients) confirmed the poor prognostic value of TF using a similar human-based score on hematoxylin-eosin staining. Integration of RNA-seq data from TCGA and LC-MS/MS proteomics from WS revealed an upregulation of extracellular matrix remodeling and focal adhesion processes in tumors with high TF, supporting their increased invasive potential. This proposed histologic parameter is an independent and unfavorable prognostic marker that could be established as a new grading parameter for LSCC.},

abstract = {The appearance of cancellous bone architecture is different for various skeletal sites and various disease states. During aging and disease, plates are perforated and connecting rods are dissolved. There is a continuous shift from one structural type to the other. So traditional histomorphometric procedures, which are based on a fixed model type, will lead to questionable results. The introduction of three-dimensional (3D) measuring techniques in bone research makes it possible to capture the actual architecture of cancellous bone without assumptions of the structure type. This requires, however, new methods that make direct use of the 3D information. Within the framework of a BIOMED I project of the European Union, we analyzed a total of 260 human bone biopsies taken from five different skeletal sites (femoral head, vertebral bodies L2 and L4, iliac crest, and calcaneus) from 52 donors. The samples were measured three-dimensionally with a microcomputed tomography scanner and subsequently evaluated with both traditional indirect histomorphometric methods and newly developed direct ones. The results show significant differences between the methods and in their relation to the bone volume fraction. Based on the direct 3D analysis of human bone biopsies, it appears that samples with a lower bone mass are primarily characterized by a smaller plate-to-rod ratio, and to a lesser extent by thinner trabecular elements.},

abstract = {The aim of segmentation of tumor regions in positron emission tomography (PET) is to provide more accurate measurements of tumor size and extension into adjacent structures, than is possible with visual assessment alone and hence improve patient management decisions. We propose a segmentation energy function for the graph cuts technique to improve lung tumor segmentation with PET. Our segmentation energy is based on an analysis of the tumor voxels in PET images combined with a standardized uptake value (SUV) cost function and a monotonic downhill SUV feature. The monotonic downhill feature avoids segmentation leakage into surrounding tissues with similar or higher PET tracer uptake than the tumor and the SUV cost function improves the boundary definition and also addresses situations where the lung tumor is heterogeneous. We evaluated the method in 42 clinical PET volumes from patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our method improves segmentation and performs better than region growing approaches, the watershed technique, fuzzy-c-means, region-based active contour and tumor customized downhill. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {MicroRNA-210 (miR-210) was initially reported to be associated with hypoxia and plays a vital role in modulating angiogenesis. However, the potential effect and underlying mechanisms of miR-210 activity in rat spinal cord injury (SCI) have not yet been fully illuminated. In the present study, differential microRNA expression after SCI was determined by Microarray analysis. To explore the effect of miR-210 after SCI, we intrathecally injected agomir-210 with Alzet Osmotic Pumps to up-regulated the endogenous miR-210 expression. Then, synchrotron radiation micro-CT (SR$\mu$CT) imaging was used to investigate the effect of agomir-210 in rat SCI model. We found that the endogenous miR-210 expression could be up-regulated by intrathecal agomir-210 injection. The administration of agomir-210 significantly promoted angiogenesis, as evidenced by increased vessel number and volume detected by SR$\mu$CT, attenuated the lesion size and improved functional recovery after SCI. Additionally, agomir-210 attenuated cellular apoptosis and inflammation in the injured rat spinal cord. Expression levels of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-1$\beta$) were significantly decreased after agomir-210 treatment, whereas expression levels of anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) proteins were up-regulated. In conclusion, our results indicated that SR$\mu$CT is a powerful imaging tool to evaluate the effects of angiogenesis after agomir-210 administration in rat SCI model. The up-regulation of endogenous miR-210 expression following agomir-210 administration promoted angiogenesis and anti-apoptotic protein expression, and attenuated inflammation. MiR-210 played a positive role in neurological functional recovery and could be a potential new therapeutic target for SCI.},

After day 10 VL followed the function W0.70. Based on the quantitative findings the postnatal lung growth could be divided into three phases. * 1Lung expansion (up to day 4): Lung volume increase resulted almost exclusively from an 87{\%} enlargement of the existing air spaces. * 2Tissue proliferation (day 4 to 13): All tissue compartments showed a pronounced mass increase, followed by a high gain in capillary volume. Alveolar and capillary surface areas (Sa, Sc) developed rapidly due to subdivision of the primitive air sacs. * 3Equilibrated growth (third week to adult age): An initial period of redistribution of tissue mass with septal lengthening and further rapid increase in Sa and Sc was followed by proportionate alveolar growth. In the adult further lengthening of the interalveolar septa or continued alveolar formation could not be excluded.During the period of fundamental internal remodelling of the lung, its function, as determined by the morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacity, was not impaired.},

abstract = {We visualized pulmonary acini in the core regions of the mouse lung in situ using synchrotron refraction-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and evaluated their kinematics during quasi-static inflation. This CT system (with a cube voxel of 2.8 $\mu$m) allows excellent visualization of not just the conducting airways, but also the alveolar ducts and sacs, and tracking of the acinar shape and its deformation during inflation. The kinematics of individual alveoli and alveolar clusters with a group of terminal alveoli is influenced not only by the connecting alveolar duct and alveoli, but also by the neighboring structures. Acinar volume was not a linear function of lung volume. The alveolar duct diameter changed dramatically during inflation at low pressures and remained relatively constant above an airway pressure of ∼8 cmH2O during inflation. The ratio of acinar surface area to acinar volume indicates that acinar distension during low-pressure inflation differed from that during inflation over a higher pressure range; in particular, acinar deformation was accordion-like during low-pressure inflation. These results indicated that the alveoli and duct expand differently as total acinar volume increases and that the alveolar duct may expand predominantly during low-pressure inflation. Our findings suggest that acinar deformation in the core regions of the lung is complex and heterogeneous.},

abstract = {The effect of pixel size and other physical parameters on the detectability of simple signals in digital radiography was investigated using a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) that is based on statistical decision theory and takes into account the characteristics of the human observer. The calculation of the SNR includes two-dimensional displayed digital signal spectra and noise Wiener spectra as well as the visual-response function and internal noise of the human observer. Threshold contrasts derived from calculated SNR's agreed well with results of an 18-alternative forced-choice observer study. Since a digital imaging system is not shift invariant, the threshold contrasts were determined for a range of alignments of the object relative to the sampling coordinates. The results indicate that a 0.2-mm pixel size may be adequate for visual detection of necessary detail in most digital radiographic examinations.},

abstract = {Studies of the origin of pulmonary blood flow heterogeneity have highlighted the significant role of vessel branching structure on flow distribution. To enable more detailed investigation of structure-function relationships in the pulmonary circulation, an anatomically based finite element model of the arterial and venous networks has been developed to more accurately reflect the geometry found in vivo. Geometric models of the arterial and venous tree structures are created using a combination of multidetector row X-ray computed tomography imaging to define around 2,500 vessels from each tree, a volume-filling branching algorithm to generate the remaining accompanying conducting vessels, and an empirically based algorithm to generate the supernumerary vessel geometry. The explicit generation of supernumerary vessels is a unique feature of the computational model. Analysis of branching properties and geometric parameters demonstrates close correlation between the model geometry and anatomical measures of human pulmonary blood vessels. A total of 12 Strahler orders for the arterial system and 10 Strahler orders for the venous system are generated, down to the equivalent level of the terminal bronchioles in the bronchial tree. A simple Poiseuille flow solution, assuming rigid vessels, is obtained within the arterial geometry of the left lung, demonstrating a large amount of heterogeneity in the flow distribution, especially with inclusion of supernumerary vessels. This model has been constructed to accurately represent available morphometric data derived from the complex asymmetric branching structure of the human pulmonary vasculature in a form that will be suitable for application in functional simulations.},

abstract = {The microstructure of food is key to its sensorial perception, and methods to characterize the microstructure are of crucial importance in food engineering. Ice cream is a special example whose microstructure changes dramatically in response to temperature variations. Since ice cream is a multiphase material, the complex interactions among the phases and the physical mechanisms that drive the evolution of microstructure are not yet well understood. This is mostly due to the fact that observing the microstructure with traditional microscopic methods is destructive and does not allow the study of undisturbed samples. With X-ray micro-tomography, it is possible to overcome these limitations and carry out time lapse studies of the evolution of the microstructure of ice cream. Using iodine as a contrast agent, we measured the three-dimensional distribution of the three main phases (air, unfrozen sugar solution, and ice crystals) with a voxel size of 6 $\mu$m. An automated routine was developed that allows for the segmentation of the three phases. Based on the three-dimensional data we calculated the temporal evolution of air bubble sizes and ice crystal sizes during cyclic variations of temperature. Under the given temperature variations we find strong hints that for ice crystal coarsening a melt refreeze mechanism and for air microstructure coarsening coalescence are the dominating underlying mechanisms. This method—which can be applied to a plethora of soft multiphase materials—provides new insights into the coarsening mechanisms of multiphase materials and could contribute to a better understanding of complex materials.},

It should provide information regarding the angiogenic mechanisms involved and should include qualitative and quantitative data of drug effects in a non-biased and time-efficient way.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAPPROACH {\&} RESULTS: Basic vascular parameters (total regenerated area, vascular projection area, contour length, vessel area density) were extracted from in vivo fluorescence microscopy images using a stereological approach. Skeletonization of the vasculature by our custom-made software Skelios provided additional parameters including "graph energy" and "distance to farthest node". The latter gave important insights into the complexity, connectivity and maturation status of the regenerating vascular network. The employment of a reference point (vascular parameters prior amputation) is unique for the model and crucial for a proper assessment. Additionally, the assay provides exceptional possibilities for correlative microscopy by combining in vivo-imaging and morphological investigation of the area of interest. The 3-way correlative microscopy links the dynamic changes in vivo with their structural substrate at the subcellular level.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The improved zebrafish fin regeneration model with advanced quantitative analysis and optional 3-way correlative morphology is a promising in vivo angiogenesis assay, well-suitable for basic research and preclinical investigations.},

abstract = {We evaluated microfocal X-ray-computed tomography (micro-CT) as a method to visualize lung architecture two and three dimensionally and to obtain morphometric data. Inflated porcine lungs were fixed by formaldehyde ventilation. Tissue samples (8-mm diameter, 10-mm height) were stained with osmium tetroxide, and 400 projection images (1,024 x 1,024 pixel) were obtained. Continuous isometric micro-CT scans (voxel size 9 microm) were acquired to reconstruct two- and three-dimensional images. Tissue samples were sectioned (8-microm thickness) for histological analysis. Alveolar surface density and mean linear intercept were assessed by stereology-based morphometry in micro-CT scans and corresponding histological sections. Furthermore, stereology-based morphometry was compared with morphometric semi-automated micro-CT analysis within the same micro-CT scan. Agreement of methods was assessed by regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Comparing histology with micro-CT, alveolar surface densities (35.4 +/- 2.4 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.9/mm, P {\textless} 0.05) showed a correlation (r = 0.72; P = 0.018) with an agreement of 2 +/- 1.6/mm; the mean linear intercept (135.7 +/- 14.5 vs. 135.8 +/- 15 microm) correlated well (r = 0.97; P {\textless} 0.0001) with an agreement of -0.1 +/- 3.4 microm. Semi-automated micro-CT analysis resulted in smaller alveolar surface densities (33.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 30.5 +/- 1/mm; P {\textless} 0.01) with a correlation (r = 0.70; P = 0.023) and agreement of 2.9 +/- 1.4/mm. Non-destructive micro-CT scanning offers the advantage to visualize the spatial tissue architecture of small lung samples two and three dimensionally.},

A very large number of novel agents have been tested, especially in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) either as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Some novel targeted agents have now shown definite activity in NSCLC, such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and bevacizumab.

This study aimed to test the feasibility of dual-perfusion techniques with the bronchial artery circulation and pulmonary artery circulation synchronously perfused using ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and evaluate the effects of dual-perfusion on posttransplant lung graft function. Using rat heart-lung blocks, we developed a dual-perfusion EVLP circuit (dual-EVLP), and compared cellular metabolism, expression of inflammatory mediators, and posttransplant graft function in lung allografts maintained with dual-EVLP, standard-EVLP, or cold static preservation. The microvasculature in lung grafts after transplant was objectively evaluated using microcomputed tomography angiography. Lung grafts subjected to dual-EVLP exhibited significantly better lung graft function with reduced proinflammatory profiles and more mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to better posttransplant function and compliance, as compared with standard-EVLP or static cold preservation. Interestingly, lung grafts maintained on dual-EVLP exhibited remarkably increased microvasculature and perfusion as compared with lungs maintained on standard-EVLP. Our results suggest that lung grafts can be perfused and preserved using dual-perfusion EVLP techniques that contribute to better graft function by reducing proinflammatory profiles and activating mitochondrial respiration. Dual-EVLP also yields better posttransplant graft function through increased microvasculature and better perfusion of the lung grafts after transplantation.},

abstract = {Fractal geometry allows structures to be quantitatively characterized in geometric terms even if their form is not even or regular, because fractal geometry deals with the geometry of hierarchies and random processes. The hypothesis is explored that fractal geometry serves as a design principle in biological organisms. The internal membrane surface of cells, or the inner lung surface, are difficult to describe in terms of classical geometry, but they are found to show properties describable by fractal geometry, at least sectionwise and within certain bounds set by deterministic design properties. Concepts of fractal geometry are most useful in characterizing the structure of branching trees, such as those found in pulmonary airways and in blood vessels. This explains how the large internal gas exchange surface of the lung can be homogeneously and efficiently ventilated and perfused at low energetic cost. It is concluded that to consider fractal geometry as a biological design principle is heuristically most productive and provides insights into possibilities of efficient genetic programming of biological form.},

abstract = {CsI(Tl) crystals of 1×1×10 cm3 were exposed to 60Co $\gamma$ rays with various doses in the range from 103 to 106 rad. The pulse height reduction, measured with a 137Cs isotope placed at the small end of the crystal opposite to a photomultiplier, varied from 28{\%} at 1.58×103 rad to more than 85{\%} at 1.83×106 rad. The radiation damage continued to be significantly saturated between 103 and 105 rad. Irradiation caused absorption of light at short wavelengths, mainly below 600 nm, making strongly irradiated crystals reddish. No sizable spontaneous recovery was observed. It was found that the damage quickly (within hours) recovers to a considerable extent by exposure to sunlight.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional structure is one of the main factors influencing the mechanical behaviour of cancellous bone. To analyse the trabecular bone structure non-destructively we used a peripheral QCT system and applied a special thin-slice technique to create high-resolution volumetric data sets serving as a basis for something we would like to call non-invasive bone biopsy. In order to obtain binary data sets, the mineralized bone in the CT volume was separated from bone marrow and muscle tissue with the help of a sophisticated three-dimensional segmentation algorithm based on the analysis of directional derivatives, which are computed from a locally approximated fit function of the original CT volume. Binary volumes including either a solid representation of trabecular plates and rods or a topological representation of the cancellous bone architecture were acquired. Such volumes can be processed non-destructively and, even more important, repetitively. By using a surface reconstruction algorithm based on interpolating triangulation it was possible to visualize the three-dimensional surface of the trabecular bone structure. The results showed that surface representation and visualization in combination with a multiple thin-slice measuring technique are valuable tools in studying three-dimensional bone architecture. In the future, the non-invasive bone biopsies will be evaluated by means of three-dimensional mechanical analysis incorporating finite element modelling and direct morphological investigations of the cancellous bone architecture for a better prediction of bone strength as an index for fracture risk or osteoporosis.},

abstract = {Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Early detection might reduce morbidity. In this study we evaluate a microCT imaging algorithm to assess in-vivo tumour load and quantification of tumour growth in a transgenic disease model of lung adenocarcinomas. MicroCT was carried out with n=10 SPC-raf transgenic mice without gating in spontaneously breathing and isoflurane anaesthetised animals. Segmentation of the air-filled spaces was obtained using a region growing algorithm by 3 independent observers. Inter- and intra-observer variability of the algorithm was determined and compared against an alternative region growing algorithm. Due to the multiple very small tumor nodules that occur and the low signal-to-noise ratio direct volumetric measurement of solitary tumor nodules is not feasible. However, tumor growth can be assessed by measuring the decrease in the segmented volume of the aerated lung areas. The presented algorithm can thus be used to evaluate therapeutic efficacies of novel treatment strategies. The imaging algorithm allows in vivo quantification of lung tumor load and tumor growth in transgenic mice with an acceptable intra- and interobserver variability.},

abstract = {The etiology of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), a progressive lung disease, remains unclear. We examined alveolar structure in UIP three-dimensionally. Lung biopsy specimens from five patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis were used. Sections 150-microm thick were stained with elastica solution for elastic fibers, with alpha-smooth muscle actin antibody for myofibroblasts, with anti-Thomsen-Friedenreich antibody for type-II pneumocytes and with anti-CD34 antibody for blood vessels. We examined them three-dimensionally using a laser confocal microscope or light microscope. In the fibrotic lesions, the thick elastic fibers forming the alveolar framework were not particularly dense considering the reduction in alveolar volume. Near the fibrotic lesions, some of the thin elastic fibers in the alveolar wall were slightly sinuous and ended with rounded tips. Type-II pneumocytes had proliferated and were distributed uniformly over the alveolar surface. Smooth muscle actin filaments were detected only around the alveolar orifice. These findings show that in UIP destruction of the elastic fiber framework of the alveoli may lead to irreversible focal alveolar collapse after damage to the alveolar epithelial cells, and proliferation of type-II pneumocytes may be involved with this elastolysis.},

abstract = {The rat lung undergoes the phase of maturation of the alveolar septa and of the parenchymal microvascular network mainly during the third postnatal week. Speculating that programmed cell death may contribute to the thinning of the alveolar septa, we searched for the presence of DNA fragmentation in rat lungs between postnatal days 6 and 36 using the TUNEL procedure. The number of positive nuclei was compared at different days. We observed an 8-fold increase of programmed cell death toward the end of the third week as compared to the days before and after this time point. The precise timing of the appearance of the peak depended on the size of the litter. Double-labeling for DNA fragmentation (TUNEL) and for type I and type II epithelial cells (antibodies E11 and MNF-116), as well as morphologic studies at electron microscopic level, revealed that during the peak of programmed cell death mainly fibroblasts and type II epithelial cells were dying. While both dying cell types were TUNEL-positive, nuclear fragments and apoptotic bodies were exclusively observed in the dying fibroblasts. We conclude that programmed cell death is involved in the structural maturation of the lung by reducing the number of fibroblasts and type II epithelial cells in the third postnatal week. We observed that the dying fibroblasts are cleared by neighboring fibroblasts in a later stage of apoptosis, and we hypothesize that type II epithelial cells are cleared by alveolar macrophages in early stages of the programmed cell death process.},

Some of these rumors appear so frequently, and in such complex, colorful, and entertaining ways that we can think of them as academic urban legends. The explanation for this phenomenon is usually that authors have lazily, sloppily, or fraudulently employed sources, and peer reviewers and editors have not discovered these weaknesses in the manuscripts during evaluation. To illustrate this phenomenon, I draw upon a remarkable case in which a decimal point error appears to have misled millions into believing that spinach is a good nutritional source of iron. Through this example, I demonstrate how an academic urban legend can be conceived and born, and can continue to grow and reproduce within academia and beyond.},

abstract = {Biomedical sensors, integrated into textiles would enable monitoring of many vitally important physiological parameters during our daily life. In this paper we demonstrate the design and performance of a textile based pulse oximeter, operating on the forefinger tip in transmission mode. The sensors consisted of plastic optical fibers integrated into common fabrics. To emit light to the human tissue and to collect transmitted light the fibers were either integrated into a textile substrate by embroidery (producing microbends with a nominal diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm) or the fibers inside woven patterns have been altered mechanically after fabric production. In our experiments we used a two-wavelength approach (690 and 830 nm) for pulse wave acquisition and arterial oxygen saturation calculation. We have fabricated different specimens to study signal yield and quality, and a cotton glove, equipped with textile based light emitter and detector, has been used to examine movement artifacts. Our results show that textile-based oximetry is feasible with sufficient data quality and its potential as a wearable health monitoring device is promising.},

abstract = {Up to now the role of lung imaging in routine diagnostic work-up of pulmonary diseases has remained rather limited. However, the well-known technical problems of lung MRI (low spatial resolution, motion artifacts, low signal-to-noise ratio of the lung parenchyma) have been reduced by recent technical advances, thus leading to a significantly improved image quality in MRI of the lungs. Compared to helical CT good results have been demonstrated using a cardiac and respiratory triggered T2 weighted turbo spin echo sequence which should be included in every imaging protocol. Recent studies have proven that MRI is comparable or even better than the gold-standard helical CT regarding the staging of bronchogenic cancer and follow-up examinations of pneumonia and lung metastases. For other indications like the assessment of pulmonary nodules and the early diagnosis of pneumonia MRI has shown promising results; however these results need to be confirmed in larger patient groups. In patients with chronic infiltrative lung disease, CT scanning remains the superior imaging modality due to the inferior spatial resolution of MRI. In conclusion MRI is a reliable alternative imaging method to helical CT for many indications; in some cases it may be a promising additional examination method.},

abstract = {Laminin self-assembles into a basement membrane polymer through specific low-affinity interactions. Recently, it was shown that the terminal short-arm domain (domains VI and V) of the B1 chain (fragment E4) possesses one of the laminin self-interaction sites [Schittny, J.C. {\&} Yurchenco, P.D. (1990) J. Cell Biol. 110, 825-832], but that the binding partner(s) of this domain is unknown. Using affinity retardation chromatography we now investigate the domain(s) fragment E4 binds to. The elution of E4 was clearly retarded on immobilized laminin and fragment E1' (three-chain short-arm complex excluding the distal part of the B1 chain), but not on immobilized E4 in calcium containing buffer and at 37 degrees C. Under the same conditions, E1' strongly interacts with immobilized E4. In addition, E1' is able to non-covalently cross-link soluble E4 to immobilized E4. No further interaction of laminin and E4 with additional fragments (P1', A, B2 and B1 chain short-arm complex without B1-domains VI-IV and without globules; E8, distal long arm and G1-3; E3, long-arm G subdomains 4 and 5) could be demonstrated. These data are interpreted as evidence that (a) the primary laminin-laminin bonds are formed between the short arms of laminin, that (b) the terminal B1 short-arm domain (E4) can interact with the short arm(s) of the A and/or B2 chain(s) (domain E1'), but does not self-interact, and that (c) due to at least three self-binding sites, laminin polymerization behaves co-operatively.},

abstract = {To adequately supply tissues with oxygen and nutrients, the formation of functional vascular networks requires generation of normal, healthy vessels and their arrangement into an effective network architecture. While our knowledge about the development of single vessels significantly increased during the last years, mechanisms responsible for network formation are still poorly understood. This is probably due to the lack of suitable methods for quantification of structural properties of microvascular networks. Previously we showed that cerebral blood flow is not increased in mice exhibiting a 2- to 3-fold higher density of normal and perfused capillaries as a result of transgenic overexpression of the human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)). Here we used vascular corrosion casting and hierarchical micro-computed tomography combined with a new network analysis tool to characterize the vascular architecture in gray and white matter of these mice. Our results indicate that VEGF overexpression leads to formation of additional micro-networks connected to higher order vessels rather than insertion of individual capillaries into the existing vessel structure. This implies that the smallest "angiogenic quantum", i.e. the final, stable result of angiogenesis and subsequent remodeling, is not a single microvessel, but a complete micro-network. In conclusion, high-resolution 3D imaging combined with network analysis can substantially improve our understanding of vascular architecture, beneficial for the development of therapeutic angiogenesis as a clinical tool for applications such as wound healing or treatment of ischemic diseases.},

abstract = {Low Reynolds number flows (Re{\textless}1) in the human pulmonary acinus are often difficult to assess due to the submillimeter dimensions and accessibility of the region. In the present computational study, we simulated three-dimensional alveolar flows in an alveolated duct at each generation of the pulmonary acinar tree using recent morphometric data. Rhythmic lung expansion and contraction motion was modeled using moving wall boundary conditions to simulate realistic sedentary tidal breathing. The resulting alveolar flow patterns are largely time independent and governed by the ratio of the alveolar to ductal flow rates, Qa/Qd. This ratio depends uniquely on geometrical configuration such that alveolar flow patterns may be entirely determined by the location of the alveoli along the acinar tree. Although flows within alveoli travel very slowly relative to those in acinar ducts, 0.021{\%}{\textless}or=Ua/Ud{\textless}or=9.1{\%}, they may exhibit complex patterns linked to the three-dimensional nature of the flow and confirm findings from earlier three-dimensional simulations. Such patterns are largely determined by the interplay between recirculation in the cavity induced by ductal shear flow over the alveolar opening and radial flows induced by wall displacement. Furthermore, alveolar flow patterns under rhythmic wall motion contrast sharply with results obtained in a rigid alveolus, further confirming the importance of including inherent wall motion to understand realistic acinar flow phenomena. The present findings may give further insight into the role of convective alveolar flows in determining aerosol kinematics and deposition in the pulmonary acinus.},

@article{Seynaeve1995,
abstract = {It is easily forgotten that not yet a hundred years ago the only way
to look into the patients' body was via invasive procedures. Within
the year of the discovery of X-rays by Conrad R{\"{o}}ntgen the need
for three dimensional imaging had been voiced. The driving force
behind this development was undoubtedly clinical motivation. Planar
X-radiographs were not satisfactory to the clinicians who urged the
radiologists to provide them with tomographic images. Between 1910
and 1940, classical tomography has been the product of individuals
rather than collective groups. It is only in the mid thirties that
scientists found out about each other and started to correspond vigorously.
Mayer was the first to suggest in 1914 the idea of tomography. Bocage,
Grossman and Vallebona all developed the idea further and built their
own equipment. In 1931 Ziedses des Plantes published the most extensive
and thorough study on tomography. In the forties and fifties a stagnation
is noticed, only further refinements to the existing equipment are
carried out. Although Frank and Takahashi published the basic principles
of axial tomography in the mid forties, we had to wait for the necessary
developments in electronics before Hounsfield was able to develop
and commercialize the first axial computer tomography in 1972 (EMI-Scanner).
At the time all the big radiology companies rushed into the field
and soon, second, third and fourth generation CT scanners became
available. Only a few years later a new way of generating images
without using ionizing radiation was introduced. Lauterbur and Damadian
produced the first low quality images with magnetic resonance, a
technique called zeugmatography by its inventors. In 1974 the first
images of a living subject were published and initial scepticism
was replaced by euphoria. This resulted in the spectacular evolution
in Magnetic Resonance that we are now observing. While it is impossible
to predict the future, the development of networks, the increase
in data acquisition and storage will spread a new light on our specialty.
A closer cooperation between radiologists, pathologists and clinicians
will undoubtedly be necessary, as well as a partial redefinition
of the radiologists task.},

abstract = {DESIGN: This study is a preliminary report on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(18F-FDG) uptake for the characterization of hypersecretory or non-hypersecretory
adrenocortical masses in patients without known neoplastic disease,
thereby minimizing the presence of adrenal metastases, and without
phaeochromocytoma, in comparison with computed tomography (CT) scanning
and with iodocholesterol scintigraphy. METHODS: Thirteen consecutive
patients with an adrenal mass scheduled to have surgery, underwent
hormonal exploration, a CT scan for tumour size measurement and an
18F-FDG positron emission tomography scan. Eleven of these patients
also had unenhanced density measurement at CT scan and iodocholesterol
scintigraphy. RESULTS: CT-scanned adrenal masses ranged in size from
2.2 to 10 cm; attenuation value was {\textless}10 Hounsfield units (HUs) in
two cases and {\textgreater}10 HU in nine. All benign lesions demonstrated iodocholesterol
uptake. In the case of malignant tumours, results were non-homogeneous:
no uptake, uptake and non-informative scintigraphy. All patients
with an adrenocortical carcinoma had positive adrenal 18F-FDG uptake
(n=3), one had a liver metastasis with positive 18F-FDG uptake, one
showed 18F-FDG uptake in an adrenal metastasis from an unknown primary
kidney tumour. All patients with a benign adrenocortical lesion had
negative 18F-FDG uptake (n=9). Patients' lesions were hypersecretory
(n=5), or non-hypersecretory (n=8), regardless of the pathology.
CONCLUSION: This short preliminary study indicates that 18F-FDG gave
a correct classification of tissue characterization with accurate
identification of malignant lesions, as well as the disease stage
(metastasis or primary). These promising preliminary results on adrenocortical
lesions, seldom studied with 18F-FDG, are to be confirmed in larger
series.},

Tomographic data sets typically consist of 1000 to 1500 projections of 1024 x 1024 to 2048 x 2048 pixels and are acquired in 5-15 min. A processing pipeline has been developed to handle this large amount of data efficiently and to reconstruct the tomographic volume within a few minutes after the end of a scan. Just a few seconds after the raw data have been acquired, a selection of reconstructed slices is accessible through a web interface for preview and to fine tune the reconstruction parameters. The same interface allows initiation and control of the reconstruction process on the computer cluster. By integrating all programs and tools, required for tomographic reconstruction into the pipeline, the necessary user interaction is reduced to a minimum. The modularity of the pipeline allows functionality for new scan protocols to be added, such as an extended field of view, or new physical signals such as phase-contrast or dark-field imaging etc.},

abstract = {We present an unbiased estimator of the total number of alveolar structures distal to the transition from a bronchiole to an alveolar duct system ('ventilatory units', VUs). In species without respiratory bronchioles, including mice, the number of VUs is equivalent to the number of acini. The acinus is a functional unit of gas exchange, defined as a parenchymal unit distal to a terminal bronchiole in which all airways contain alveoli and thus participate in gas exchange. The estimator combines two different estimators of the number of VUs: (1) an estimator derived from the Euler number of all the openings of the bronchial tree and (2) an estimator derived from direct counts of topological changes occurring at bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions. Combining the two estimators eliminates the requirement to be able to identify even vanishingly small pieces of bronchial tissue in physical disectors. We implemented the fractionator estimator in five adult mice lungs using physical fractionators with varying but known sampling fractions (Horvitz-Thompson estimator). We obtained total values of about 4200 VUs (CV = 0.05) in 21-day-old and 4480 (CV = 0.06) in 69-day-old animals. Being fractionator estimates, these total numbers are independent of shrinkage. The densities of VUs per unit volume of tissue (values corrected for tissue shrinkage) were similar in left and right lungs.},

abstract = {X-ray radiographic absorption imaging is an invaluable tool in medical diagnostics and materials science. For biological tissue samples, polymers or fibre composites, however, the use of conventional X-ray radiography is limited due to their weak absorption. This is resolved at highly brilliant X-ray synchrotron or micro-focus sources by using phase-sensitive imaging methods to improve the contrast1, 2. However, the requirements of the illuminating radiation mean that hard-X-ray phase-sensitive imaging has until now been impractical with more readily available X-ray sources, such as X-ray tubes. In this letter, we report how a setup consisting of three transmission gratings can efficiently yield quantitative differential phase-contrast images with conventional X-ray tubes. In contrast with existing techniques, the method requires no spatial or temporal coherence, is mechanically robust, and can be scaled up to large fields of view. Our method provides all the benefits of contrast-enhanced phase-sensitive imaging, but is also fully compatible with conventional absorption radiography. It is applicable to X-ray medical imaging, industrial non-destructive testing, and to other low-brilliance radiation, such as neutrons or atoms.},

We defined acini as the complex of alveolated airways distal to the terminal bronchioles--that is, beginning with the first-order respiratory or transitional bronchiole. The morphological properties of pulmonary acini are described. The acinar volume averages 187 mm3 (SD +/- 79 mm3). Intraacinar airways branch dichotomously over about 9 generations (range 6-12). The internal airway diameter falls from 500 micron to 270 micron between acinar generations 0 and 10, whereas the outer diameter (including the sleeve of alveoli) remains constant at 700 micron. Towards the periphery the size of alveoli increases and clusters of alveoli become more numerous. The longitudinal path length of acinar airways (defined as the distance along the ducts from the transitional bronchiole to the alveolar sacs) averages 8.8 mm (+/- 1.4 mm). The morphometric data collected in this study are used to construct an idealized model of human acinar airways that can be related to existing models of the human bronchial tree.},

Achieving resolutions of the order of micrometres may become particularly challenging owing to increased dose, which in the worst case can be lethal for the imaged animal model. A framework for linking image quality to radiation dose in order to optimize experimental parameters with respect to dose reduction is presented. The approach may find application for current and future in vivo studies to facilitate proper experiment planning and radiation risk assessment on the one hand and exploit imaging capabilities on the other.},

@article{Massaro1985,
abstract = {In many species, including humans, pulmonary alveoli are formed after birth by septal subdivision of the large gas-exchange saccules present at birth. In rats septation occurs mainly between the 4th and 14th postnatal days (Burri, P. H. 1974. Anat. Rec. 180:77-98), but little is known about the regulation of this process. We found that dexamethasone (0.1 micrograms daily) given to rats from age 4 to 13 d markedly impaired saccule septation to at least age 60 d and also diminished the extent of the increase of alveolar surface area (Sa). Underfeeding from birth to age 14 d did not diminish saccule septation but did result in diminished Sa. We conclude dexamethasone-treated rats have a critical period during which the gas-exchange saccules present at birth must be subdivided. Since Sa increased in dexamethasone-treated rats without a change in alveolar size, and, the enlargement of Sa was diminished in underfed rat pups without a deficit of saccule septation, we postulate new alveoli were formed by means other than septation of the large gas-exchange saccules present at birth. Furthermore, these various means of forming alveoli, and hence of increasing Sa, were differently regulated: dexamethasone decreased the enlargement of Sa brought about by both septation of the gas-exchange saccules present at birth and by other, as yet unidentified, means of forming alveoli; underfeeding did not diminish Sa increases produced by saccule septation but did decrease the extent of Sa enlargement due to the other means of forming alveoli.},

abstract = {Most image processing and visualization applications allow users to configure computation parameters and manipulate the resulting visualizations. SCIRun, VolView, MeVisLab, and the Medical Interaction Toolkit (MITK) are four image processing and visualization frameworks that were built for these purposes. All frameworks are freely available and all allow the use of the ITK C++ library. In this paper, the benefits and limitations of each visualization framework are presented to aid both application developers and users in the decision of which framework may be best to use for their application. The analysis is based on more than 50 evaluation criteria, functionalities, and example applications. We report implementation times for various steps in the creation of a reference application in each of the compared frameworks. The data-flow programming frameworks, SCIRun and MeVisLab, were determined to be best for developing application prototypes, while VolView was advantageous for nonautomatic end-user applications based on existing ITK functionalities, and MITK was preferable for automated end-user applications that might include new ITK classes specifically designed for the application.},

@article{Rodt2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a novel tool for monitoring acute and chronic disease states in small laboratory animals. Its value for assessing progressive lung fibrosis in mice has not been reported so far. Here we examined the importance of in vivo micro-CT as non-invasive tool to assess progression of pulmonary fibrosis in mice over time. METHODS Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in mice by intratracheal delivery of an adenoviral gene vector encoding biologically active TGF-$\beta$1 (AdTGF-$\beta$1). Respiratory gated and ungated micro-CT scans were performed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks post pulmonary adenoviral gene or control vector delivery, and were then correlated with respective histopathology-based Ashcroft scoring of pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Visual assessment of image quality and consolidation was performed by 3 observers and a semi-automated quantification algorithm was applied to quantify aerated pulmonary volume as an inverse surrogate marker for pulmonary fibrosis. RESULTS We found a significant correlation between classical Ashcroft scoring and micro-CT assessment using both visual assessment and the semi-automated quantification algorithm. Pulmonary fibrosis could be clearly detected in micro-CT, image quality values were higher for respiratory gated exams, although differences were not significant. For assessment of fibrosis no significant difference between respiratory gated and ungated exams was observed. CONCLUSIONS Together, we show that micro-CT is a powerful tool to assess pulmonary fibrosis in mice, using both visual assessment and semi-automated quantification algorithms. These data may be important in view of pre-clinical pharmacologic interventions for the treatment of lung fibrosis in small laboratory animals.},

@article{Roth-Kleiner2004,
abstract = {Tenascin-C (TNC) is a multidomain extracellular matrix protein that contributes to organogenesis and tumorgenesis. To elucidate its developmental function in the context of TNC deficiency, lung lobes of TNC null mice were obtained at Embryonic Days E11.5 and E12.5 and cultured for 3 d. In lung explants of homozygote TNC-deficient embryos (E12.5) the number of future airway branches was reduced by 36{\%} as compared with wild-type. In heterozygote explants only half of the reduction (18{\%}) was observed. No significant alteration, neither of the explant growth nor of the pattern of airway branching, was noticed in TNC-null explants. However, the terminal endbuds of the transgenic explants were enlarged. The results are supported by a morphologic investigation at Postnatal Day P2, where the airspaces of TNC-deficient lungs appeared larger than in wild-type lungs. Taken together, our results represent the first developmental phenotype of TNC-null mice. We conclude that TNC takes part in the control of fetal lung branching, and that not only the presence of TNC but also its amount is important. Because TNC is predominantly expressed at the growing tip of the future airways, we hypothesize that TNC promotes the penetration into the surrounding mesenchyme and the branching of the growing airways.},

abstract = {Image processing algorithms and a prototypical research software tool have been developed for visualization and quantitative analysis of vessels in data sets from computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. The software is based on a sequence of processing steps, which are as follows: (a) vessel segmentation based on a region growing algorithm, (b) interactive "premasking" to optionally exclude interfering structures close to the vessels of interest, (c) distance transform-based skeletonization, (d) multiplanar reformation orthogonal to the vessel path, (e) identification of the lumen boundary on the orthogonal cross-section images, and (f) morphometric measurements. The development of the algorithmic components and the application user interface has been carried out in close cooperation with clinical users to achieve a high degree of usability and flexible support of work flow. The software has been successfully applied to the intracranial arteries, carotid arteries, and abdominal and thoracic aorta, as well as the renal, coronary, and peripheral arteries.},

abstract = {Synchrotron-based X-ray Tomographic Microscopy is a powerful technique for fast, non-destructive, high resolution quantitative volumetric investigations on diverse samples. At the TOMCAT (TOmographic Microscopy and Coherent radiology experimenTs) beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS), synchrotron light is delivered by a 2.9 T superbend. The main optical component, a Double Crystal Multilayer Monochromator, covers an energy range between 8 and 45 keV. The standard TOMCAT detector offers field of views ranging from 0.75x0.75 mm2 up to 12.1x12.1mm2 with a theoretical resolution of 0.37 µm and 5.92 µm, respectively. The beamline design and flexible endstation setup make a large range of investigations possible. In addition to routine measurements, which exploit the absorption contrast, the high coherence of the source also enables phase contrast tomography, implemented with two complementary techniques. Differential Phase Contrast (DPC) imaging has been fully integrated in terms of fast acquisition and data reconstruction. Scans of samples within an aqueous environment are also feasible. The second phase contrast method is a Modified Transport of Intensity approach that yields a good approximation of the 3D phase distribution of a weakly absorbing object from a single tomographic dataset. Typical acquisition times for a tomogram are in the order of few minutes, ensuring high throughput and allowing for semi-dynamical investigations and in-situ experiments. Raw data are automatically post-processed online and full reconstructed volumes are available shortly after a scan with minimal user intervention. In addition to a beamline overview, a selection of high-impact tomographic applications will be presented.},

abstract = {Stereological tools are the gold standard for accurate (i.e., unbiased) and precise quantification of any microscopic sample. The past decades have provided a broad spectrum of tools to estimate a variety of parameters such as volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers. Some of them require pairs of parallel sections that can be produced by either physical or optical sectioning, with optical sectioning being much more efficient when applicable. Unfortunately, transmission electron microscopy could not fully profit from these riches, mainly because of the large depth of field. Hence, optical sectioning was a long-time desire for electron microscopists. This desire was fulfilled with the development of electron tomography that yield stacks of slices from electron microscopic sections. Now, parallel optical slices of a previously unimagined small thickness (2-5 nm axial resolution) can be produced. These optical slices minimize problems related to overprojection effects, and allow for direct stereological analysis, e.g., volume estimation with the Cavalieri principle and number estimation with the optical disector method. Here, we demonstrate that the symbiosis of stereology and electron tomography is an easy and efficient way for quantitative analysis at the electron microscopic level. We call this approach quantitative 3D electron microscopy.},

The localization precision measured for the detected fluorophores is commonly used to describe the maximal attainable resolution. However, this measure takes not all experimental factors, which impact onto the finally achieved resolution, into account. Several other methods to measure the resolution of super-resolved images were previously suggested, typically relying on intrinsic standards, such as molecular rulers, or on a priori knowledge about the specimen, e.g. its spatial frequency content. Here we show that Fourier ring correlation provides an easy-to-use, laboratory consistent standard for measuring the resolution of SRM images.

abstract = {The effects of lung injury on pulmonary recruitment are incompletely understood. X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been a valuable tool in assessing changes in recruitment during lung injury. With the development of preclinical CT scanners designed for thoracic imaging in rodents, it is possible to acquire high-resolution images during the evolution of a pulmonary injury in living mice. We quantitatively assessed changes in recruitment caused by intratracheal bleomycin at 1 and 3 wk after administration using micro-CT in 129S6/SvEvTac mice. Twenty female mice were administered 2.5 U of bleomycin or saline and imaged with micro-CT at end inspiration and end expiration. Mice were extubated and allowed to recover from anesthesia and then reevaluated in vivo for quasi-static compliance measurements, followed by harvesting of the lungs for collagen analysis and histology. CT images were converted to histograms and analyzed for mean lung attenuation (MLA). MLA was significantly greater for bleomycin-exposed mice at week 1 for both inspiration (P{\textless}0.0047) and exhalation (P{\textless}0.0377) but was not significantly different for week 3 bleomycin-exposed mice. However, week 3 bleomycin-exposed mice did display significant increases in MLA shift from expiration to inspiration compared with either group of control mice (P{\textless}0.005), suggesting increased lung recruitment at this time point. Week 1 bleomycin-exposed mice displayed normal shifts in MLA with inspiration, suggesting normal lung recruitment despite significant radiographic and histological changes. Lung alveolar recruitment is preserved in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced parenchymal injury despite significant changes in radiographic and physiological parameters.},

abstract = {We explore the question of whether and to what extent the large variation in energy requirements observed among mammals is related to variations in the design of the respiratory system, from the lung to the mitochondria in muscle cells. Resting metabolic rate is determined by body size (allometric variation). Maximal rates of O 2 consumption (V̇ O2 max) also vary in a regular manner with body size, but adaptive variation allows some species to achieve much higher values than others of the same body size. We, therefore, consider adaptive variation as modulation of structures and functions above those determined by allometric variation. A model is presented that separates functional and design parameters at four steps of the respiratory cascade: the pulmonary gas exchanger, heart and blood, microvasculature, and mitochondria. The variations observed in these parameters are analyzed with respect to those in energy demand and are discussed in relation to the hypothesis of symmorphosis. We conclude that the design of the internal steps of the respiratory system (mitochondria, capillaries, blood, and heart) is matched to functional demand, whereas the lung maintains a variable excess of morphometric diffusing capacity which may be related to the facts that the lung has limited malleability and that it forms the interface with the environment. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

abstract = {Vascular corrosion casting has been established as a method to reconstruct the three-dimensional (3D) structure of blood vessels of organs and tissues. After replacing the blood volume with a low viscosity resin, the surrounding tissue is removed to replicate the vascular architecture, typically using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To date available casting resins have had significant limitations such as lack of viscosity, leading to insufficient perfusion of smallest capillaries in organs and tissues of smaller species, interaction with surrounding tissue or fragility of resulting casts. We have reported here about a new polyurethane-based casting resin (PU4ii) with superior physical and imaging characteristics. Low viscosity, timely polymerization, and minimal shrinking of PU4ii produces high quality casts, including the finest capillaries. These casts are highly elastic while retaining their original structure to facilitate postcasting tissue dissection and pruning of casts. SEM images illustrate the high reproduction quality, including endothelial cell imprints, features that allow one to discern arterial and veinal vessels. For quantitative analysis, casts from PU4ii can be imaged using micro-computed tomography to produce digital 3D reconstructions. The inherent fluorescence of PU4ii is sufficient to reproduce casts with or without tissue using confocal microscopy (CM). Because of the simplified casting procedure, the high reproducibility and the superior reproduction quality, a combination of vascular corrosion casting using PU4ii with advanced imaging technologies has great potential to support the description of vascular defects and drug effects in disease models using mutant mice.},

@article{Bassett2000,
abstract = {In the exercising human, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) is limited by the ability of the cardiorespiratory system to deliver oxygen to the exercising muscles. This is shown by three major lines of evidence: 1) when oxygen delivery is altered (by blood doping, hypoxia, or beta-blockade), VO2max changes accordingly; 2) the increase in VO2max with training results primarily from an increase in maximal cardiac output (not an increase in the a-v O2 difference); and 3) when a small muscle mass is overperfused during exercise, it has an extremely high capacity for consuming oxygen. Thus, O2 delivery, not skeletal muscle O2 extraction, is viewed as the primary limiting factor for VO2max in exercising humans. Metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle are, however, critical for improving submaximal endurance performance. Endurance training causes an increase in mitochondrial enzyme activities, which improves performance by enhancing fat oxidation and decreasing lactic acid accumulation at a given VO2. VO2max is an important variable that sets the upper limit for endurance performance (an athlete cannot operate above 100{\%} VO2max, for extended periods). Running economy and fractional utilization of VO2max also affect endurance performance. The speed at lactate threshold (LT) integrates all three of these variables and is the best physiological predictor of distance running performance.},

abstract = {Visualization on the anatomical vessel networks plays a vital role in the physiological or pathological investigations. However, so far it still remains a big challenge to identify the fine structures of the smallest capillary vessel networks via conventional imaging ways. Here, the room temperature liquid metal angiography was proposed for the first time to generate mega contrast X-ray images for multiscale vasculature mapping. Particularly, gallium was adopted as the room temperature liquid metal contrast agent and infused into the vessels of in vitro pig hearts and kidneys. We scanned the samples under X-ray and compared the angiograms with those obtained via conventional contrast agent--the iohexol. As quantitatively demonstrated by the grayscale histograms and numerical indexes, the contrast of the vessels to the surrounding tissues in the liquid metal angiograms is orders higher than that of the iohexol enhanced images. And the angiogram has reached detailed enough width of 0.1 mm for the tiny vessels, which indicated that the capillaries can be clearly distinguished under the liquid metal enhanced images. Further, with tomography from the micro-CT, we also managed to reconstruct the 3-D structures of the kidney vessels. Tremendous clarity and efficiency of the method over existing approaches have been experimentally clarified. It was disclosed that the usually invisible capillary networks now become distinctively clear in the gallium angiograms. This basic mechanism has generalized purpose and can be extended to a wide spectrum of 3-D computational tomographic areas. It opens a new soft tool for quickly reconstructing high-resolution spatial channel networks for scientific researches as well as engineering practices where complicated and time-consuming resections are no longer a necessity.},

abstract = {Micro-CT has become a powerful technique in non-destructive 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. First results were limited to the investigation of osteoporosis in cancellous bone. But the availability of systems with almost microscopic resolution and sufficient soft tissue contrast has opened up entirely new applications for laboratory investigation of blood vessels and soft tissues. This article gives an overview of micro-CT technology and the potential of three-dimensional imaging of the vessel wall and soft-tissue architecture imaging in different organs using different contrast perfusion and staining techniques. Micro-CT provides quantitative information on human plaque morphology equivalent to histomorphometric analysis. Based on differences in grey-scale attenuations, micro-CT also correctly identifies atherosclerotic lesions that are histologically classified as fibrous plaques, calcified lesions, fibroatheroma, and lipid rich lesions. Micro-CT is a promising method to visualize the architecture of the renal vasculature and, importantly, to separate cortex and medulla for the visualization of glomeruli and their afferent and efferent arterioles. Micro-CT can determine the vascular surface in a defined placental volume. Combining of micro-CT data and total placental volume enables an estimation of the approximate surface of the placental vasculature. The diameter of opacified vessels in the investigated samples ranged from 2 mm (chorion plate artery) to 14 micro m (smallest vessel diameter, terminal loop). Recognizing that lung parenchyma can only be visualized if the alveoli are completely expanded and the contrast of the thin alveolar walls is enhanced, we tested two preparation methods: (1) fixation of lung tissue with formalin vapour and staining with silver nitrate, and (2) intravenous injection of a barium sulfate-gelatine-thymol mixture in vivo in the anesthetized animal. We evaluated the ability of this mixture to enter the pulmonary microcirculation and the technical feasibility of micro-CT to assess lung micro-architecture.},

abstract = {We investigated the influence of transpulmonary (Ptp) and vascular pressures on the size of the pores of Kohn in primary alveolar septa. Dogs lungs, perfused and ventilated in situ, were rapidly frozen with Freon 22 in zone II or III conditions following deflation to Ptp of 5, 15, or 25 cmH2O. Frozen samples were freeze-substituted for transmission electron microscopy. Five fields containing at least one pore each were selected randomly from each section of tissue, and the minimum diameter visible in the cut section was measured. For both zone II and III conditions, as Ptp increased, mean pore size increased. The mean pore size under zone III conditions was 1.2015, 1.788, and 2.249 micrometer for Ptp of 5, 15, and 25 cmH2O, respectively. For zone 2 conditions, the corresponding values were 1.1438, 1,8757, and 2.08 micrometer. For both zones II and III, increasing capillary hydrostatic pressure had no significant effect on pore size. The results support the notion that alveolar pores can increase collateral ventilation by dynamically stretching as Ptp increases. Capillary pressure does not influence pore size probably because of collagen fibers, which surround the pore lumen. Presumably, these fibers resist encroachment of capillaries on the pore lumen as vascular pressures increase.},

@article{Gostling2008,
abstract = {Experimental analyses of decay in a tunicate deuterostome and three lophotrochozoans indicate that the controls on decay and preservation of embryos, identified previously based on echinoids, are more generally applicable. Four stages of decay are identified regardless of the environment of death and decay. Embryos decay rapidly in oxic and anoxic conditions, although the gross morphology of embryos is maintained for longer under anoxic conditions. Under anoxic reducing conditions, the gross morphology of the embryos is maintained for the longest period of time, compatible with the timescale required for bacterially mediated mineralization of soft tissues. All four stages of decay were encountered under all environmental conditions, matching the spectrum of preservational qualities encountered in all fossil embryo assemblages. The preservation potential of embryos of deuterostomes and lophotrochozoans is at odds with the lack of such embryos in the fossil record. Rather, the fossil record of embryos, as sparse as it is, is dominated by forms interpreted as ecdysozoans, cnidarians, and stem-metazoans. The dearth of deuterostome and lophotrochozoan embryos may be explained by the fact that ecdysozoans, at least, tend to deposit their eggs in the sediment rather than through broadcast spawning. However, fossil embryos remain very rare and the main controlling factor on their fossilization may be the unique conspiracy of environmental conditions at a couple of sites. The preponderance of fossilized embryos of direct developers should not be used in evidence against the existence of indirect development at this time in animal evolutionary history.},

abstract = {Abstract  A deeper knowledge of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the pulmonary acinus has direct applications in studies on acinar fluid dynamics and aerosol kinematics. To date, however, acinar flow simulations have been often based on geometrical models inspired by morphometrical studies; limitations in the spatial resolution of lung imaging techniques have prevented the simulation of acinar flows using 3D reconstructions of such small structures. In the present study, we use high-resolution, synchrotron radiation-based X-ray tomographic microscopy (SRXTM) images of the pulmonary acinus of a mouse to reconstruct 3D alveolar airspaces and conduct computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations mimicking rhythmic breathing motion. Respiratory airflows and Lagrangian (massless) particle tracking are visualized in two examples of acinar geometries with varying size and complexity, representative of terminal sacculi including their alveoli. The present CFD simulations open the path towards future acinar flow and aerosol deposition studies in complete and anatomically realistic multi-generation acinar trees using reconstructed 3D SRXTM geometries.},

In the past, these tasks were often performed manually due to the lack of automated algorithms that can tolerate false branches and anatomical variability typical for in vivo trees. In this paper, we present algorithms that perform both matching of branchpoints and anatomical labeling of in vivo trees without any human intervention and within a short computing time. No hand-pruning of false branches is required. The results from the automated methods show a high degree of accuracy when validated against reference data provided by human experts. 92.9{\%} of the verifiable branchpoint matches found by the computer agree with experts' results. For anatomical labeling, 97.1{\%} of the automatically assigned segment labels were found to be correct.},

abstract = {In order to obtain further insight into the mechanisms relating to the large lung volumes of swimmers, tests of mechanical lung function, including lung distensibility (K) and elastic recoil, pulmonary diffusion capacity, and respiratory mouth pressures, together with anthropometric data (height, weight, body surface area, chest width, depth and surface area), were compared in eight elite male swimmers, eight elite male long distance athletes and eight control subjects. The differences in training profiles of each group were also examined. There was no significant difference in height between the subjects, but the swimmers were younger than both the runners and controls, and both the swimmers and controls were heavier than the runners. Of all the training variables, only the mean total distance in kilometers covered per week was significantly greater in the runners. Whether based on: (a) adolescent predicted values; or (b) adult male predicted values, swimmers had significantly increased total lung capacity ((a) 145 +/- 22{\%}, (mean +/- SD) (b) 128 +/- 15{\%}); vital capacity ((a) 146 +/- 24{\%}, (b) 124 +/- 15{\%}); and inspiratory capacity ((a) 155 +/- 33{\%}, (b) 138 +/- 29{\%}), but this was not found in the other two groups. Swimmers also had the largest chest surface area and chest width. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was largest in the swimmers ((b) 122 +/- 17{\%}) and FEV1 as a percentage of forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC){\%} was similar for the three groups. Pulmonary diffusing capacity (DLCO) was also highest in the swimmers (117 +/- 18{\%}). All of the other indices of lung function, including pulmonary distensibility (K), elastic recoil and diffusion coefficient (KCO), were similar. These findings suggest that swimmers may have achieved greater lung volumes than either runners or control subjects, not because of greater inspiratory muscle strength, or differences in height, fat free mass, alveolar distensibility, age at start of training or sternal length or chest depth, but by developing physically wider chests, containing an increased number of alveoli, rather than alveoli of increased size. However, in this cross-sectional study, hereditary factors cannot be ruled out, although we believe them to be less likely.},

abstract = {This study provides a quantitative description of the small airways and alveolar duct-alveolar architecture of the rat lung. To accomplish this, quantitative three-dimensional reconstructions were made of small airways, the alveolar duct system, and alveoli. The branching pattern of the small airways immediately proximal to the alveolar ducts varied significantly. For example, the number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per parent bronchus (terminal bronchiole) ranged from two to six. The number of bronchiole-alveolar duct junctions per lung was 7,280 +/- 250 (mean +/- SE). The general shape of the ventilatory unit arising from each bronchiole-alveolar junction was that of a space-filling sphere with an outer diameter of 1,490 +/- 130 microns. The average distance from the bronchiole-alveolar duct junction to alveoli at the end of the alveolar sac termination was 1,290 +/- 100 microns. Numerous trifurcations were found in the branching pattern of the alveolar ducts. The branching of the alveolar ducts did not fit a regular dichotomous pattern. The volume of the terminal branches (alveolar sacs) accounted for 64 +/- 5{\%} of the volume of the ventilatory unit. Both of these factors, the pattern of branching and the substantial volume distributed in the most peripheral branches, contribute to the uniform distribution of gas within the ventilatory unit and thus minimize potential diffusion limitations to gas exchange.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the three-dimensional (3-D) micro-architecture of lung tissue can provide insights into the pathology of lung disease. Micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) has previously been used to elucidate lung 3D histology and morphometry in fixed samples that have been stained with contrast agents or air inflated and dried. However, non-destructive microstructural 3D imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues would facilitate retrospective analysis of extensive tissue archives of lung FFPE lung samples with linked clinical data. Methods: FFPE human lung tissue samples (n=4) were scanned using a Nikon metrology $\mu$CT scanner. Semi-automatic techniques were used to segment the 3D structure of airways and blood vessels. Airspace size (mean linear intercept, Lm) was measured on $\mu$CT images and on matched histological sections from the same FFPE samples imaged by light microscopy to validate $\mu$CT imaging. Results: The $\mu$CT imaging protocol provided contrast between tissue and paraffin in FFPE samples (15mm x 7mm). Resolution (voxel size 6.7 $\mu$m) in the reconstructed images was sufficient for semi-automatic image segmentation of airways and blood vessels as well as quantitative airspace analysis. The scans were also used to scout for regions of interest, enabling time-efficient preparation of conventional histological sections. The Lm measurements from $\mu$CT images were not significantly different to those from matched histological sections. Conclusion: We demonstrated how non-destructive imaging of routinely prepared FFPE samples by laboratory $\mu$CT can be used to visualize and assess the 3D morphology of the lung including by morphometric analysis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Classic histology is the gold standard for vascular network imaging and analysis. The method however is laborious and prone to artefacts. Here, the suitability of ultramicroscopy (UM) and micro-computed tomography (CT) was studied to establish potential alternatives to histology. METHODS The vasculature of murine organs (kidney, heart and atherosclerotic carotid arteries) was visualized using conventional 2D microscopy, 3D light sheet ultramicroscopy (UM) and micro-CT. Moreover, spheroid-based human endothelial cell vessel formation in mice was quantified. Fluorescently labeled Isolectin GS-IB4 A647 was used for in vivo labeling of vasculature for UM analysis, and analyses were performed ex vivo after sample preparation. For CT imaging, animals were perfused postmortem with radiopaque contrast agent. RESULTS Using UM imaging, 3D vascular network information could be obtained in samples of animals receiving in vivo injection of the fluorescently labeled Isolectin GS-IB4. Resolution was sufficient to measure single endothelial cell integration into capillaries in the spheroid-based matrigel plug assay. Because of the selective staining of the endothelium, imaging of larger vessels yielded less favorable results. Using micro-CT or even nano-CT, imaging of capillaries was impossible due to insufficient X-ray absorption and thus insufficient signal-to-noise ratio. Identification of lumen in murine arteries using micro-CT was in contrast superior to UM. CONCLUSION UM and micro-CT are two complementary techniques. Whereas UM is ideal for imaging and especially quantifying capillary networks and arterioles, larger vascular structures are easier and faster to quantify and visualize using micro-CT. 3D information of both techniques is superior to 2D histology. UM and micro-CT together may open a new field of clinical pathology diagnosis.},

abstract = {Airway geometry measurements can provide information regarding pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology. There has been considerable interest in measuring intrathoracic airways in two-dimensional (2-D) slices from volumetric X-ray computed tomography (CT). Such measurements can be used to evaluate and track the progression of diseases affecting the airways. A popular airway measurement method uses the "half-max" criteria, in which the gray level at the airway wall is estimated to be halfway between the minimum and maximum gray levels along a ray crossing the edge. However, because the scanning process introduces blurring, the half-max approach may not be applicable across all airway sizes. We propose a new measurement method based on a model of the scanning process. In our approach, we examine the gray-level profile of a ray crossing the airway wall and use a maximum-likelihood method to estimate the airway inner and outer radius. Using CT scans of a physical phantom, we present results showing that the new approach is more accurate than the half-max method at estimating wall location for thin-walled airways.},

abstract = {Structural data about the human lung fine structure are mainly based on stereological methods applied to serial sections. As these methods utilize 2D images, which are often not contiguous, they suffer from inaccuracies which are overcome by analysis of 3D micro-CT images of the never-sectioned specimen. The purpose of our study was to generate a complete data set of the intact three-dimensional architecture of the human acinus using high-resolution synchrotron-based micro-CT (synMCT). A human lung was inflation-fixed by formaldehyde ventilation and then scanned in a 64-slice CT over its apex to base extent. Lung samples (8-mm diameter, 10-mm height, N = 12) were punched out, stained with osmium tetroxide, and scanned using synMCT at (4 $\mu$m)(3) voxel size. The lung functional unit (acinus, N = 8) was segmented from the 3D tomographic image using an automated tree-analysis software program. Morphometric data of the lung were analyzed by ANOVA. Intra-acinar airways branching occurred over 11 generations. The mean acinar volume was 131.3 ± 29.2 mm(3) (range, 92.5-171.3 mm(3)) and the mean acinar surface was calculated with 1012 ± 26 cm(2). The airway internal diameter (starting from the bronchiolus terminalis) decreases distally from 0.66 ± 0.04 mm to 0.34 ± 0.06 mm (P {\textless} 0.001) and remains constant after the seventh generation (P {\textless} 0.5). The length of each generation ranges between 0.52 and 0.93 mm and did not show significant differences between the second and eleventh generation. The branching angle between daughter branches varies between 113-degree and 134-degree without significant differences between the generations (P {\textless} 0.3). This study demonstrates the feasibility of quantitating the 3D structure of the human acinus at the spatial resolution readily achievable using synMCT.},

abstract = {Estimation of alveolar number in the lung has traditionally been done by assuming a geometric shape and counting alveolar profiles in single, independent sections. In this study, we used the unbiased disector principle to estimate the Euler characteristic (and thereby the number) of alveolar openings in rat lungs and rhesus monkey lung lobes and to obtain robust estimates of average alveolar volume. The estimator of total alveolar number was based on systematic, uniformly random sampling using the fractionator sampling design. The number of alveoli in the rat lung ranged from 17.3 x 10(6) to 24.6 x 10(6), with a mean of 20.1 x 10(6). The average number of alveoli in the two left lung lobes in the monkey ranged from 48.8 x 10(6) to 67.1 x 10(6) with a mean of 57.7 x 10(6). The coefficient of error due to stereological sampling was of the order of 0.06 in both rats and monkeys and the biological variation (coefficient of variance between individuals) was 0.15 in rat and 0.13 in monkey (left lobe, only). Between subdivisions (left/right in rat and cranial/caudal in monkey) there was an increase in variation, most markedly in the rat. With age (2-13 years) the alveolar volume increased 3-fold (as did parenchymal volume) in monkeys, but the alveolar number was unchanged. This study illustrates that use of the Euler characteristic and fractionator sampling is a robust and efficient, unbiased principle for the estimation of total alveolar number in the lung or in well-defined parts of it.},

Using the total length and the length density of the free septal edge as measured for the formation of new septa, we followed alveolarization throughout postnatal lung development (days 2-125). Furthermore, the alveolar surface area was estimated. The formation of new septa was observed until day 36. Approximately 10{\%} of the septa present in adult mice were formed prenatally by branching morphogenesis, approximately 50{\%} were generated postnatally before and approximately 40{\%} after maturation of the alveolar microvasculature. Approximately 5{\%} of the alveolar surface area present during adulthood was present before alveolarization started, approximately 55{\%} was formed during alveolarization (days 4-36) and approximately 40{\%} afterward due to growth processes. We conclude that alveolarization continues until young adulthood and that the maturation of the alveolar microvasculature does not preclude further alveolarization.},

abstract = {Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray has great potential for its applications in both diagnosis and treatment of diseases, due to its characteristic properties including coherence, collimation, monochromaticity, and exceptional brightness. Great advances have been made regarding potential medical applications of SR X-ray in recent years, particularly with the development of the third generation of SR light sources. However, multiple studies have also suggested damaging effects of SR X-ray on biological samples ranging from protein crystals to cells and biological tissues. It has become increasingly important to conduct comprehensive studies on two closely related topics regarding SR X-ray in medical applications: The safety issues regarding the medical applications of SR X-ray and the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between SR X-ray and biological tissues. In this article, we attempted to provide an overview of the literatures regarding these two increasingly significant topics. We also proposed our hypothesis that there are significant differences between the biological tissue-damaging mechanisms of SR X-ray and those of normal X-ray, due to the characteristic properties of SR X-ray such as high dose rate. Future studies are warranted to test this hypothesis, which may profoundly improve our understanding regarding the fundamental mechanisms underlying the interactions between light and matter. These studies would also constitute an essential basis for establishing the safety standard for the medical applications of SR X-ray.},

The Cell Centered Database or CCDB is built on an object-relational framework using Oracle 8i and is housed on a server at the San Diego Supercomputer Center at the University of California, San Diego. Data can be deposited and accessed via a web interface. Each volume reconstruction is stored with a full set of descriptors along with tilt images and any derived products such as segmented objects and animations. Tomographic data are supplemented by high-resolution light microscopic data in order to provide correlated data on higher-order cellular and tissue structure. Every object segmented from a reconstruction is included as a distinct entity in the database along with measurements such as volume, surface area, diameter, and length and amount of protein labeling, allowing the querying of image-specific attributes. Data sets obtained in response to a CCDB query are retrieved via the Storage Resource Broker, a data management system for transparent access to local and distributed data collections. The CCDB is designed to provide a resource for structural biologists and to make tomographic data sets available to the scientific community at large.},

abstract = {Toaccess the risks and chances of deposition of submicron particlesin the gas-exchange area of the lung, a precise three-dimensional(3D)-localization of the sites of deposition is essential—especially because localpeaks of deposition are expected in the acinar tree andin individual alveoli. In this study we developed the workflowfor such an investigation. We administered 200-nm gold particles toyoung adult rats by intratracheal instillation. After fixation and paraffinembedding, their lungs were imaged unstained using synchrotron radiation x-raytomographic microscopy (SRXTM) at the beamline TOMCAT (Swiss Light Source,Villigen, Switzerland) at sample detector distances of 2.5 mm (absorptioncontrast) and of 52.5 mm (phase contrast). A segmentation basedon a global threshold of grey levels was successfully doneon absorption-contrast images for the gold and on the phase-contrastimages for the tissue. The smallest spots containing gold possesseda size of 1–2 voxels of 370-nm side length. Weconclude that a combination of phase and absorption contrast SRXTMimaging is necessary to obtain the correct segmentation of bothtissue and gold particles. This method will be used forthe 3D localization of deposited particles in the gas-exchange areaof the lung.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n $\backslash$n {\textcopyright}2011 American Institute of Physics},

@article{Begall2008a,
abstract = {We demonstrate by means of simple, noninvasive methods (analysis of satellite images, field observations, and measuring "deer beds" in snow) that domestic cattle (n = 8,510 in 308 pastures) across the globe, and grazing and resting red and roe deer (n = 2,974 at 241 localities), align their body axes in roughly a north-south direction. Direct observations of roe deer revealed that animals orient their heads northward when grazing or resting. Amazingly, this ubiquitous phenomenon does not seem to have been noticed by herdsmen, ranchers, or hunters. Because wind and light conditions could be excluded as a common denominator determining the body axis orientation, magnetic alignment is the most parsimonious explanation. To test the hypothesis that cattle orient their body axes along the field lines of the Earth's magnetic field, we analyzed the body orientation of cattle from localities with high magnetic declination. Here, magnetic north was a better predictor than geographic north. This study reveals the magnetic alignment in large mammals based on statistically sufficient sample sizes. Our findings open horizons for the study of magnetoreception in general and are of potential significance for applied ethology (husbandry, animal welfare). They challenge neuroscientists and biophysics to explain the proximate mechanisms.},

The mouse has turned out to be an invaluable model for mammalian genetic modifications to mimic and analyse cardiovascular pathology. Through the introduction of transgene and gene targeting technology, regulatory systems can be studied at the molecular level. Recent technical developments have down-sized the equipment for physiological measurements to the mouse level. Micro-surgery has developed to the level where most manipulations previously performed in larger animals can now be applied to mice. However, different investigators report considerable differences in values for physiological parameters. Whether these differences are related to the variation in mouse strains or experimental procedures remains to be established, but awareness of the variation can be relevant for prospective mouse investigators. In the present review, the physiological measurements performed in mice to date are discussed and complemented with results from genetically manipulated animals. In addition the various surgical procedures and their practical application are illustrated.},

This protocol describes how to initiate tumors in two conditional genetic models of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using the activation of oncogenic K-ras alone or in combination with the loss of function of p53. We discuss methods for sporadic expression of Cre in the lungs through engineered adenovirus or lentivirus, and provide a detailed protocol for the administration of the virus by intranasal inhalation or intratracheal intubation. The protocol requires 1-5 min per mouse with an additional 30-45 min to set-up and allow for the recovery of mice from anesthesia. Mice may be analyzed for tumor formation and progression starting 2-3 weeks after infection.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding the three-dimensional (3-D) micro-architecture of lung tissue can provide insights into the pathology of lung disease. Micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) has previously been used to elucidate lung 3D histology and morphometry in fixed samples that have been stained with contrast agents or air inflated and dried. However, non-destructive microstructural 3D imaging of formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues would facilitate retrospective analysis of extensive tissue archives of lung FFPE lung samples with linked clinical data. Methods: FFPE human lung tissue samples (n=4) were scanned using a Nikon metrology $\mu$CT scanner. Semi-automatic techniques were used to segment the 3D structure of airways and blood vessels. Airspace size (mean linear intercept, Lm) was measured on $\mu$CT images and on matched histological sections from the same FFPE samples imaged by light microscopy to validate $\mu$CT imaging. Results: The $\mu$CT imaging protocol provided contrast between tissue and paraffin in FFPE samples (15mm x 7mm). Resolution (voxel size 6.7 $\mu$m) in the reconstructed images was sufficient for semi-automatic image segmentation of airways and blood vessels as well as quantitative airspace analysis. The scans were also used to scout for regions of interest, enabling time-efficient preparation of conventional histological sections. The Lm measurements from $\mu$CT images were not significantly different to those from matched histological sections. Conclusion: We demonstrated how non-destructive imaging of routinely prepared FFPE samples by laboratory $\mu$CT can be used to visualize and assess the 3D morphology of the lung including by morphometric analysis.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most valuable modalities for in vivo imaging because it is fast, high-resolution, cost-effective, and non-invasive. Moreover, CT is heavily used not only in the clinic (for both diagnostics and treatment planning) but also in preclinical research as micro-CT. Although CT is inherently effective for lung and bone imaging, soft tissue imaging requires the use of contrast agents. For small animal micro-CT, nanoparticle contrast agents are used in order to avoid rapid renal clearance. A variety of nanoparticles have been used for micro-CT imaging, but the majority of research has focused on the use of iodine-containing nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles. Both nanoparticle types can act as highly effective blood pool contrast agents or can be targeted using a wide variety of targeting mechanisms. CT imaging can be further enhanced by adding spectral capabilities to separate multiple co-injected nanoparticles in vivo. Spectral CT, using both energy-integrating and energy-resolving detectors, has been used with multiple contrast agents to enable functional and molecular imaging. This review focuses on new developments for in vivo small animal micro-CT using novel nanoparticle probes applied in preclinical research.},

abstract = {Characterisation and quantification of tissue structures is limited by sectioning-induced artefacts and by the difficulties of visualising and segmenting 3D volumes. Here we demonstrate that, even in the absence of X-ray contrast agents, X-ray computed microtomography (microCT) and nanotomography (nanoCT) can circumvent these problems by rapidly resolving compositionally discrete 3D tissue regions (such as the collagen-rich adventitia and elastin-rich lamellae in intact rat arteries) which in turn can be segmented due to their different X-ray opacities and morphologies. We then establish, using X-ray tomograms of both unpressurised and pressurised arteries that intra-luminal pressure not only increases lumen cross-sectional area and straightens medial elastic lamellae but also induces profound remodelling of the adventitial layer. Finally we apply microCT to another human organ (skin) to visualise the cell-rich epidermis and extracellular matrix-rich dermis and to show that conventional histological and immunohistochemical staining protocols are compatible with prior X-ray exposure. As a consequence we suggest that microCT could be combined with optical microscopy to characterise the 3D structure and composition of archival paraffin embedded biological materials and of mechanically stressed dynamic tissues such as the heart, lungs and tendons.},

abstract = {Study of cerebral vascular structure broadens our understanding of underlying variations, such as pathologies that can lead to cerebrovascular disorders. The development of high resolution 3D imaging modalities has provided us with the raw material to study the blood vessels in small animals such as mice. However, the high complexity and 3D nature of the cerebral vasculature make comparison and analysis of the vessels difficult, time-consuming and laborious. Here we present a framework for automated segmentation and recognition of the cerebral vessels in high resolution 3D images that addresses this need. The vasculature is segmented by following vessel center lines starting from automatically generated seeds and the vascular structure is represented as a graph. Each vessel segment is represented as an edge in the graph and has local features such as length, diameter, and direction, and relational features representing the connectivity of the vessel segments. Using these features, each edge in the graph is automatically labeled with its anatomical name using a stochastic relaxation algorithm. We have validated our method on micro-CT images of C57Bl/6J mice. A leave-one-out test performed on the labeled data set demonstrated the recognition rate for all vessels including major named vessels and their minor branches to be {\textgreater}75{\%}. This automatic segmentation and recognition methods facilitate the comparison of blood vessels in large populations of subjects and allow us to study cerebrovascular variations.},

abstract = {The lungs are dually perfused by the pulmonary artery and the bronchial arteries. This study aimed to test the feasibility of dual-perfusion techniques with the bronchial artery circulation and pulmonary artery circulation synchronously perfused using ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) and evaluate the effects of dual-perfusion on posttransplant lung graft function. Using rat heart-lung blocks, we developed a dual-perfusion EVLP circuit (dual-EVLP), and compared cellular metabolism, expression of inflammatory mediators, and posttransplant graft function in lung allografts maintained with dual-EVLP, standard-EVLP, or cold static preservation. The microvasculature in lung grafts after transplant was objectively evaluated using microcomputed tomography angiography. Lung grafts subjected to dual-EVLP exhibited significantly better lung graft function with reduced proinflammatory profiles and more mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to better posttransplant function and compliance, as compared with standard-EVLP or static cold preservation. Interestingly, lung grafts maintained on dual-EVLP exhibited remarkably increased microvasculature and perfusion as compared with lungs maintained on standard-EVLP. Our results suggest that lung grafts can be perfused and preserved using dual-perfusion EVLP techniques that contribute to better graft function by reducing proinflammatory profiles and activating mitochondrial respiration. Dual-EVLP also yields better posttransplant graft function through increased microvasculature and better perfusion of the lung grafts after transplantation.},

abstract = {Non-bone in vivo micro-CT imaging has many potential applications for preclinical evaluation. Specifically, the in vivo quantification of changes in the vascular network and organ morphology in small animals, associated with the emergence and progression of diseases like bone fracture, inflammation and cancer, would be critical to the development and evaluation of new therapies for the same. However, there are few published papers describing the in vivo vascular imaging in small animals, due to technical challenges, such as low image quality and low vessel contrast in surrounding tissues. These studies have primarily focused on lung, cardiovascular and brain imaging. In vivo vascular imaging of mouse hind limbs has not been reported. We have developed an in vivo CT imaging technique to visualize and quantify vasculature and organ structure in disease models, with the goal of improved quality images. With 1-2 minutes scanning by a high speed in vivo micro-CT scanner (Quantum CT), and injection of a highly efficient contrast agent (Exitron nano 12000), vasculature and organ structure were semi-automatically segmented and quantified via image analysis software (Analyze). Vessels of the head and hind limbs, and organs like the heart, liver, kidneys and spleen were visualized and segmented from density maps. In a mouse model of bone metastasis, neoangiogenesis was observed, and associated changes to vessel morphology were computed, along with associated enlargement of the spleen. The in vivo CT image quality, voxel size down to 20 $\mu$m, is sufficient to visualize and quantify mouse vascular morphology. With this technique, in vivo vascular monitoring becomes feasible for the preclinical evaluation of small animal disease models.},

abstract = {Abnormalities in the cerebrovascular system play a central role in many neurologic diseases. The on-going expansion of rodent models of human cerebrovascular diseases and the need to use these models to understand disease progression and treatment has amplified the need for reproducible non-invasive imaging methods for high-resolution visualization of the complete cerebral vasculature. In this study, we present methods for in vivo high-resolution (19 $\mu$m isotropic) computed tomography imaging of complete mouse brain vasculature. This technique enabled 3D visualization of large cerebrovascular networks, including the Circle of Willis. Blood vessels as small as 40 $\mu$m were clearly delineated. ACTA2 mutations in humans cause cerebrovascular defects, including abnormally straightened arteries and a moyamoya-like arteriopathy characterized by bilateral narrowing of the internal carotid artery and stenosis of many large arteries. In vivo imaging studies performed in a mouse model of Acta2 mutations demonstrated the utility of this method for studying vascular morphometric changes that are practically impossible to identify using current histological methods. Specifically, the technique demonstrated changes in the width of the Circle of Willis, straightening of cerebral arteries and arterial stenoses. We believe the use of imaging methods described here will contribute substantially to the study of rodent cerebrovasculature.},

Different techniques are used for highlighting vasculature, in vivo and ex vivo, in 2-D or 3-D including histological staining, immunohistochemistry, radiography, angiography, microscopy, computed tomography (CT) or micro-CT, both stand-alone and synchrotron system. Vascularization can be studied with or without a contrast agent. This paper presents the results obtained with the latest Skyscan micro-CT (Skyscan 1272, Bruker, Belgium) following barium sulphate injection replacing the bloodstream in comparison with results obtained with a Skyscan In Vivo 1076. Different hard and soft tissues were perfused with contrast agent and were harvested. Samples were analysed using both forms of micro-CT, and improved results were shown using this new micro-CT. This study highlights the vasculature using micro-CT methods. The results obtained with the Skyscan 1272 are clearly defined compared to results obtained with Skyscan 1076. In particular, this instrument highlights the high number of small vessels, which were not seen before at lower resolution. This new micro-CT opens broader possibilities in detection and characterization of the 3-D vascular tree to assess vascular tissue engineering strategies.},

A total of 100 abdominal CT examinations were presented to four observers. There were 56 examinations showing appendicitis and 44 which were normal. The observers viewed the images using a UMPC display and an LCD monitor and rated each examination on a five-point scale. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to test for differences. The sensitivity and specificities of all observers were similarly high. The average area under the ROC curve for readings performed on the UMPC and the LCD monitor was 0.959 and 0.976, respectively. There were no significant differences between the two display systems for interpreting abdominal CTs. The web-based mobile teleradiology system appears to be feasible for reading abdominal CTs for diagnosing appendicitis and may be valuable in emergency teleconsultation.},

We report on a new tube technology satisfying all these demands by making use of a novel cooling principle on one hand and of a novel beam control system on the other hand. Nowadays tubes use a rotating anode disk mainly cooled via radiation. The Straton{\textregistered}x-ray tube is the first tube available for clinical routine utilizing convective cooling exclusively. It is demonstrated that this cooling principle makes large heat storage capacities of the anode disk obsolete. The unprecedented cooling rate of 4.8 MHU/min eliminates the need for waiting times due to anode cooling in clinical workflow. Moreover, an electronic beam deflection system for focal spot position and size control opens the door to advanced applications. The physical backgrounds are discussed and the technical realization is presented. From this discussion the superior suitability of this tube to withstand g-forces well above 20 g created by fast rotating gantries will become evident. Experience from a large clinical trial is reported and possible ways for future developments are discussed.},

abstract = {Interventional and fluoroscopic imaging procedures for pediatric patients are becoming more prevalent because of the less-invasive nature of these procedures compared to alternatives such as surgery. Flat-panel X-ray detectors (FPD) for fluoroscopy are a new technology alternative to the image intensifier/TV (II/TV) digital system that has been in use for more than two decades. Two major FPD technologies have been implemented, based on indirect conversion of X-rays to light (using an X-ray scintillator) and then to proportional charge (using a photodiode), or direct conversion of X-rays into charge (using a semiconductor material) for signal acquisition and digitization. These detectors have proved very successful for high-exposure interventional procedures but lack the image quality of the II/TV system at the lowest exposure levels common in fluoroscopy. The benefits for FPD image quality include lack of geometric distortion, little or no veiling glare, a uniform response across the field-of-view, and improved ergonomics with better patient access. Better detective quantum efficiency indicates the possibility of reducing the patient dose in accordance with ALARA principles. However, first-generation FPD devices have been implemented with less than adequate acquisition flexibility (e.g., lack of tableside controls/information, inability to easily change protocols) and the presence of residual signals from previous exposures, and additional cost of equipment and long-term maintenance have been serious impediments to purchase and implementation. Technological advances of second generation and future hybrid FPD systems should solve many current issues. The answer to the question "how much better are they?" is "significantly better", and they are certainly worth consideration for replacement or new implementation of an imaging suite for pediatric fluoroscopy.},

abstract = {A source of x-rays capable of exciting the characteristic emission lines of Mo and Ag is demonstrated. The device, which requires no external high voltage supply, uses the triboelectric effect to produce a charge imbalance when silicone and a metal-loaded epoxy are made to repeatedly contact each other in vacuum. This provides a source of 40 keV electrons which generate bremsstrahlung and characteristic x-rays at a rate of {\textgreater} 10 5 per contact cycle. By increasing the repetition rate of the contact cycle the viability of a device that emits 10 8   x-ray photons per second is suggested, making triboelectricity an inexpensive source of x-rays. The form factors and simplicity of such devices open up interesting possibilities for x-ray imaging.},

abstract = {Since the discovery of X-rays over a century ago the techniques applied to the engineering of X-ray sources have remained relatively unchanged. From the inception of thermionic electron sources, which, due to simplicity of fabrication, remain central to almost all X-ray applications, there have been few fundamental technological advances. However, with the emergence of ever more demanding medical and inspection techniques, including computed tomography and tomosynthesis, security inspection, high throughput manufacturing and radiotherapy, has resulted in a considerable level of interest in the development of new fabrication methods. The use of conventional thermionic sources is limited by their slow temporal response and large physical size. In response, field electron emission has emerged as a promising alternative means of deriving a highly controllable electron beam of a well-defined distribution. When coupled to the burgeoning field of nanomaterials, and in particular, carbon nanotubes, such systems present a unique technological opportunity. This review provides a summary of the current state-of-the-art in carbon nanotube-based field emission X-ray sources. We detail the various fabrication techniques and functional advantages associated with their use, including the ability to produce ever smaller electron beam assembles, shaped cathodes, enhanced temporal stability and emergent fast-switching pulsed sources. We conclude with an overview of some of the commercial progress made towards the realisation of an innovative and disruptive technology.},

abstract = {CALDose{\_}X is a software tool that provides the possibility of calculating incident air kerma (INAK) and entrance surface air kerma (ESAK), two important quantities used in x-ray diagnosis, based on the output of the x-ray equipment. Additionally, the software uses conversion coefficients (CCs) to assess the absorbed dose to organs and tissues of the human body, the effective dose as well as the patient's cancer risk for radiographic examinations. The CCs, ratios between organ or tissue absorbed doses and measurable quantities, have been calculated with the FAX06 and the MAX06 phantoms for 34 projections of 10 commonly performed x-ray examinations, for 40 combinations of tube potential and filtration ranging from 50 to 120 kVcp and from 2.0 to 5.0 mm aluminum, respectively, for various field positions, for 29 selected organs and tissues and simultaneously for the measurable quantities, INAK, ESAK and kerma area product (KAP). Based on the x-ray irradiation parameters defined by the user, CALDose{\_}X shows images of the phantom together with the position of the x-ray beam. By using true to nature voxel phantoms, CALDose{\_}X improves earlier software tools, which were mostly based on mathematical MIRD5-type phantoms, by using a less representative human anatomy.},

abstract = {CMOS vision sensors, as all electronic systems, are very sensitive to temperature variation. Mainly, this sensitivity limits their DC electrical behaviour. So far, no elegant integrated solution of this shortcoming has been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a compensation technique within the circuit in order to decrease power consumption and response time. To overcome this defect caused by temperature, we propose a temperature compensation method based on drain current IDS characteristics with temperature. Among these characteristics we have a Zero Temperature Coefficient (ZTC) which will be used to compensate temperature variation. With this method, we reduce 98{\%} of the influence of temperature on the output value of a standard CMOS image sensor, and obtain good temperature stability (1 mV) in the temperature ranges from -30°C to 125°C. The proposed temperature compensation method is described in details in this paper. Finally, we present simulations results, along with advantages and disadvantages of our compensation method.},

abstract = {Digital x-ray detectors are now the detector of choice in many X-ray examinations. They have been accepted into clinical practice over the past decade but there are still ongoing developments in the technology. Complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) active pixel sensors (APS) are a novel digital technology that offers advantages compared to some of the more established approaches (charge-coupled devices (CCD), thin film transistor arrays (TFT) and CMOS passive pixel sensors (PPS)). This thesis looks at the performance of these new sensors and attempts to identify their role in future medical imaging applications. Standard electro-optical and x-ray performance evaluations of two novel CMOS APS, namely the large Area Sensor (LAS) and Dexela CMOS x-ray detector, are presented. The evaluation was made in terms of the photon transfer curve (PTC), the modulation transfer function (MTF), the normalized noise power spectrum (NNPS) and the resultant detective quantum efficiency (DQE). Modifications were introduced to extend the standard methods to overcome technical limitations. The performance of these detectors was compared to three commercial systems (Remote RadEye HR (CMOS APS), Hamamatsu C9732DK (CMOS PPS) and Anrad SMAM (a-Se TFT)) at beam qualities (28 kV for mammography and 52 kV and 74 kV for general radiography) based on the IEC standards. Both the LAS and Dexela CMOS detectors demonstrate enhanced performance. The effect of the CMOS APS inherent nonlinearity on the x-ray performance was also evaluated. Finally, the measured performance parameters were used to simulate images for different mammographic imaging tasks in order to establish possible areas of application for the new sensors. Two software phantoms (one representing a 3-D breast and the other the CDMAM test tool) were used to simulate a range of mammographic conditions. The results show that both novel CMOS APS detectors offer high image quality compared to the commercial detector systems.},

abstract = {The purpose of this work was to study physico-chemical changes in irradiating aqueous sucrose solutions from the point of view of their usefulness for technological dosimetry. Non-irradiated sucrose solutions are optically "empty" in the visible and near UV range. After gamma irradiation an absorption band with a maximum at 263 nm appears. It was confirmed that this band can be used as dosimetric signal for the dose range: 1-10 kGy. The species responsible for the 263 nm band is a neutral product of sucrose oxidation by an OH radical. High energy electron irradiation creates another UV absorbing species with the absorption band peaked at 270 nm. Further investigations are necessary to establish to what extent it can be used for electron beam dosimetry.},

abstract = {Fourth generation medical X-ray scanners using a gantry with a rotating X-ray source and a fixed circular detector array as sensor head, are too slow for imaging of the process dynamics for instance in multiphase flows. To avoid inconsistent measurements and motion blurring, all measurements need to be carried out in a short time compared to the time constants of the process dynamics. Two different high speed tomographic imaging systems are presented here demonstrating that image rates of several thousand images per second is possible.},
