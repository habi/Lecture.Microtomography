I generated large visualizations of the teeth here in MeVisLab on `anamic04` with the `VisualizationTooth*.mlab` files in ~/P/Documents/ZMK.
The saved images are (consecutively numbered) TIFF images which I just `rsync`ed into this folder and only kept the last one.
The bash script crops all these TIFFs to a central part and makes the background transparent, so we're ready to add them to the presentation.
