\begin{questions}

\question Describe what happens with the the X-rays once they are emitted from the X-ray source until they are converted to an image in the detector of a desktop micro-CT or large human CT.
	Can you describe all interactions with the sample and what needs to happen until we get a projection image on disk?

\question In a desktop \uct the researcher can change the voxel size of the image acquisition nearly continuously (in a certain bandwidth).
	This is not possible in a large CT which is used for imaging humans in a hospital.
	Why is this so?

\question A researcher wants to image a sample with approximately \SI{30}{\centi\meter} with a very small voxel size (let's say below \SI{1}{\micro\meter}).
	Is this possible or not?
	Explain your reasoning.

\question Why are the blood vessels in \autoref{fig:1265} not visible, but are visible in \autoref{fig:5158}?
	\emph{Mouse 1265} in \autoref{fig:1265} is the same sample you have seen throughout the lecture.
	Compare the contrast of the skull bones, which is visible in both images; it looks quite equal.
	Both samples have been scanned on different machines and with with settings that result in slightly different voxel sizes, but this is \emph{not} the cause\ldots
